<p class="noindent">The biological perspective on human behavior was enhanced by the introduction of the concept of “inclusive fitness” in 1963 by W. D. Hamilton in “The Evolution of Altruistic Behavior.” Hamilton recognized that while humans are fundamentally given to self-oriented behavior, they also undertake occasional acts of altruism or self-sacrifice that offer no apparent benefits <span id="page_284" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="284"></span>in terms of the life of the individual. Hamilton sought to reconcile these apparent contradictions by positing that the fundamental maximizing unit is not the individual organism but the gene. Individuals in any species will seek to maximize not simply their own personal well-being but what Hamilton called their “inclusive fitness.” He argued that “inclusive fitness” involves not only personal survival in the Darwinian sense, but also the enhanced reproduction and survival of close relatives who share the same genes.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch09en52" href="part0023_split_009.html#ch09-en52" class="calibre4">52</a></sup> Hamilton’s “inclusive fitness” thesis helps illuminate many otherwise curious features of human societies, including aspects of politics in nation-states.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">Altruism: Misnomer or Fossil Kin Selection?</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">According to Van Den, Berghe, “Altruism, then, is directed mostly at kin, especially at close kin, and is, in fact, a misnomer. It represents the ultimate genetic selfishness. It is but the blind expression of inclusive fitness maximization.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch09en53" href="part0023_split_009.html#ch09-en53" class="calibre4">53</a></sup> This is not to say, however, that there is no altruism absent the close genetic relationship referred to by Hamilton and Van Den Berghe. The uncertainties introduced by the fact that humans reproduce sexually rather than through asexual cloning all but guarantee that an inclination to “inclusive fitness maximization” would stimulate a good deal of “altruism” rebounding to the benefit of alleles other than the “selfish gene.” In the first instance, there is always the possibility that some persons who undertake helping actions may do so in the mistaken assumption that they are helping close kin. The father who undertakes a sacrificial action for his offspring may not, in fact, be the progenitor but may merely think he is.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch09-fn4" href="part0015_split_017.html#ch09fn4" class="calibre4">IV</a></sup> This is not merely a theme for soap operas; it is illustrative of a primordial puzzle— that survival of the “selfish genes” is probably facilitated if each apparent father behaves “as if” he actually is the father, despite the possibility that he is not.</p>
<p class="indent">Seen in their proper light, however, as Hirshleifer points out, many of the paradoxes of “altruism” are semantic muddles that frequently confuse or mislead people into losing sight of the context of competition in which “helping” could convey a survival advantage: “ ‘If an altruism choice of strategy is to be <i class="calibre3">viable</i> in competition with non-altruism, altruism must contribute to self-survival more than non-altruism does, and therefore it can’t really be altruism.’ All such muddles could be avoided if we drop the term ‘altruism’ and ask instead: What are the determinants of the entirely objective phenomenon that can be called <i class="calibre3">helping?”</i><sup class="sup"><a id="ch09en54" href="part0023_split_009.html#ch09-en54" class="calibre4">54</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">This question is perhaps most interesting in the case of “kinship helping.” <span id="page_285" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="285"></span>Hamilton’s basic formulation of inclusive fitness involved a biological cost-benefit analysis in which an individual, or “the gene controlling helping behaviour,” values the survival of an identical copy of itself equally to its own survival. Therefore, the willingness to undertake helping, let alone sacrifice, varies with the chance that another individual has an identical gene. “Specifically, a gene for kinship helping instructs a man (other things equal) to give his life if he can thereby save two siblings, four half-siblings, eight cousins, etc.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch09en55" href="part0023_split_009.html#ch09-en55" class="calibre4">55</a></sup></p>
