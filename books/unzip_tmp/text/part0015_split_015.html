<h2 class="h1" id="calibre_pb_15">M<span class="smallcaps1">ULTICULTURALISM AND</span> V<span class="smallcaps1">ICTIMIZATION</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">In its twilight, with a faltering capacity to redeem promises of something for nothing from an empty pocket, the welfare state found it expedient to foster new myths of discrimination. Many categories of officially “oppressed” people were designated, especially in North America. Individuals in groups with designated status as “victims” were informed that they were not responsible for shortcomings in their own lives. Rather, the fault was said to lie with “dead white males” of European descent, and the oppressive power structure allegedly rigged to the disadvantage of the excluded groups. To be black, female, homosexual, Latino, francophone, disabled, etc. was to be entitled to recompense for past repression and discrimination.</p>
<p class="indent">If Lasch’s argument is to be believed, the purpose of heightening a sense of victimization was to undermine nations, making it easier for the new, <span id="page_313" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="313"></span>footloose information elite to escape the commitments and duties of citizenship. We are not entirely convinced that the new elite, especially most of those in the mass media, are cunning enough to reason to such a posture. It would almost be reassuring to feel that they were. We see the growth of victimization as mainly an attempt to buy social peace by not only widening membership in the meritocracy as Lasch argues, but also by reconstituting the rationalizations for income redistribution. The new sport of victimology emerged in its most exaggerated form in North America because information technology penetrated more deeply there. We suspect, however, that new myths of discrimination will be common, to one degree or another, in all industrial societies in their senile state. The multiethnic welfare states in North America were simply more vulnerable to the temptation to foist the costs of income redistribution on the private sector. They were able to do this, while inflaming a sense of grievance and entitlement, by blaming the structure of society as a whole, and white men in general, for the economic shortcomings of various subcultures within society.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">The Megapolitics of Innovation</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">Even before information technology began to threaten “creative destruction” of the industrial economy, it had clearly antiquated much of the cherished myth of Marxists and socialists. We examined the megapolitics of innovation in a previous chapter. The point we emphasized there is of importance in placing the social impact of the Information Revolution into perspective. The precedent of technology expanding employment opportunities in recent centuries seems like a dependable rule of economic life, but it need not be. It is possible for earnings to be concentrated in the hands of a prosperous minority.</p>
