<p class="noindent">The geographic tether on imagination is still so tight that some experts examining the Internet in 1995 concluded that it has little commercial potential and almost no significance other than as an electronic medium for chat and an outlet for pornography. The many doubters of the economic importance of cyberspace are the Colonel Blimps of the Information Age. Their complacency rivals that of the British establishment facing the decline of the empire in the 1930s. Whenever elites find themselves threatened, their first reaction is denial. This is evidenced by the fond hope that the Internet will never amount to much, sometimes endorsed by authorities who should know better. We referred earlier to David Kline and Daniel Burstein’s work, <i class="calibre3">Road Warriors: Dreams and Nightmares Along the Information Highway.</i> Their dismissal of <span id="page_201" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="201"></span>the economic potential of the Net is another proof that being technically well-informed is not synonymous with understanding the consequences of technology,<sup class="sup"><a id="ch07en7" href="part0023_split_007.html#ch07-en7" class="calibre4">7</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Even the most technically expert observers in the past have frequently failed to grasp the implications of new technologies. A British parliamentary committee, convened in 1878 to consider the prospects for Thomas Edison’s incandescent lamp, reported Edison’s ideas to be “good enough for our transatlantic friends,… but unworthy of the attention of practical or scientific men.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch07en8" href="part0023_split_007.html#ch07-en8" class="calibre4">8</a></sup> Thomas Edison himself was a man of great vision, but he thought that the phonograph he invented would be employed mainly by businessmen for dictation. Only a short time before the Wright brothers proved that airplanes would fly, the distinguished American astronomer Simon Newcomb authoritatively demonstrated why heavier-than-air flight was impossible. He concluded: “The demonstration that no possible combination of known substances, known forms of machinery and known forms of force, can be united in a practical machine by which men shall fly long distances through the air, seems to the writer as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any physical fact to be.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch07en9" href="part0023_split_007.html#ch07-en9" class="calibre4">9</a></sup> Soon after airplanes began to fly, another renowned astronomer, William H. Pickering, explained to the public why commercial travel would never get off the ground: “The popular mind often pictures gigantic flying machines speeding across the Atlantic and carrying innumerable passengers in a way analogous to our modern steamships.…[I]t is clear that with our present devices there is no hope of competing for racing speed with either our locomotives or our automobiles.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch07en10" href="part0023_split_007.html#ch07-en10" class="calibre4">10</a></sup> We have previously recalled another wildly inaccurate prophecy about the potential of a new technology—the forecast from the beginning of the twentieth century by the makers of Mercedes that there would never be more than a million automobiles worldwide. Again, they knew more about automobiles than almost anyone but they could not have been more wrong in estimating the impact of autos on society.</p>
<p class="indent">Given this tradition of clueless misunderstandings, it is hardly surprising that many observers are slow to grasp the most important implications of the new information technology—the fact that it transcends the tyranny of place. The new technology creates for the first time an infinite, nonterrestrial realm for economic activity. It opens an option to explore the new frontiers of the cybereconomy, to “think globally and act globally.” This chapter explains why.</p>
