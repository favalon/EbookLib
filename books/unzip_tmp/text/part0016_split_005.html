<p class="noindent">The fervent desire to “make laws,” which seems so much a part of the “common sense” of twentieth-century politics, is by no means universal to all cultures. Its disappearance in the future could be seen as part of a cycle that has waxed and waned with the centuries. For example, early Greeks, among others, believed that laws could not be made. In the words of philosopher Ernst Cassirer, the Greeks believed “the ‘unwritten laws,’ the laws of justice, have no beginning in time.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch10en22" href="part0023_split_010.html#ch10-en22" class="calibre4">22</a></sup> Like other prepolitical peoples, they <span id="page_349" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="349"></span>felt that no one could improve upon the natural, “geometrical” laws of justice that had not been created by any human power.</p>
<p class="indent">They did not believe in a “lawgiver.” As Cassirer put it, “It is by rational thought that we are to find the standards of moral conduct, and it is reason, and reason alone, that can give them their authority.” In this sense, any attempt to impose laws upon society through legislation would be like trying to alter geometry by legislation.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">Legislation as Sacrilege</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">For very different reasons, a similar resistance to “lawmaking” prevailed through much of the medieval period. As John B. Morrall writes, “[F]or the Germans, law was something which had existed from time immemorial.” It was “a guarantee of the rights” of individual members of the tribe.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch10en23" href="part0023_split_010.html#ch10-en23" class="calibre4">23</a></sup> Kings and councils</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote2">
<p class="block">had as yet no intention of creating new law. Such an intention would have been, from the point of view of these early medieval times, not only superfluous… but even semi-blasphemous, for law, like kingship, possessed its own sacrosanct aura. Instead, king and councillors thought of themselves as merely explaining or clarifying the true meaning of the already existing and complete body of law.</p>
<p class="block1i">Germanic custom handed on to the medieval mind an idea which it was never able to forget, even when in practice it behaved otherwise. This idea was that good laws were rediscovered or restated but never remade.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch10en24" href="part0023_split_010.html#ch10-en24" class="calibre4">24</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">After the excesses of twentieth-century legislation, there is something quaint about that ancient attitude. The desire to put the coercive power of the state to work for private ends, particularly the redistribution of income, became almost second nature.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">Regrets</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">Little wonder, then, that there are sad songs for politics in its last days. They are entirely predictable. And not only because they reflect the blindness of most thinkers to the imperatives of megapolitics. Few political reporters, like Dionne, are prepared to accept the apparent atrophy and demise of politics, when doing so might put them back on the crime beat. At the end of the Middle Ages, voices were raised in support of reviving chivalry. Consider <i class="calibre3">II Libro del Cortegiano,</i> or <i class="calibre3">The Book of the Courtier,</i> written by Count Baldassare Castiglione in 1514, and published at Venice in 1528 by Aldus.</p>
<p class="indent">Castiglione’s longing for a return to virtues of chivalry was deeply felt, <span id="page_350" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="350"></span>but longing for a defunct way of life could not bring it back in the sixteenth century. Nor will it in the twenty-first century.</p>
<p class="indent">As we have attempted to convey in explaining our theory of megapolitics, technological imperatives, not popular opinion, are the most important sources of change in today’s world. If our theory of megapolitics is valid, the reason the modem age, with its concept of citizenship and politics organized around the state, supplanted the feudal system and chivalry organized around personal oaths and relationships was not a matter of ideas, but shifts in costs and benefits arising from new technology. Chivalry did not the because Castiglione or others failed to convince a disinterested populace who had any control over the matter that there was no need for honor or morality in the affairs of state. To the contrary, Castiglione’s <i class="calibre3">Courtier</i> is critical of princes and the kind of behavior his contemporary, Niccolo Machiavelli, commended in his <i class="calibre3">II Principe,</i> or <i class="calibre3">The Prince.</i> But so what? Machiavelli ultimately reached a larger audience with his book, not because his argument in <i class="calibre3">The Prince</i> was more eloquent but because his advice better suited the megapolitical conditions of the modern age.</p>
<p class="indent">As the distinguished twentieth-century philosopher Ernst Cassirer said in discussing “The Moral Problem in Machiavelli,”</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote2">
<p class="block">The book describes, with complete indifference, the ways and means by which political power is to be acquired and maintained. About the right use of this power it does not say a word.… No one had ever doubted that political <i class="calibre3">life,</i> as matters stand, is full of crimes, treacheries and felonies. But no thinker before Machiavelli had undertaken to teach the <i class="calibre3">art</i> of these crimes. These things were done, but they were not taught. That Machiavelli promised to become a teacher in the art of craft, perfidy, and cruelty was a thing unheard of.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch10en25" href="part0023_split_010.html#ch10-en25" class="calibre4">25</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">In short, <i class="calibre3">The Prince</i> was a radical work that spelled out a modern recipe whereby an aspiring ruler could succeed in advancing his career at any cost to others. Machiavelli endorsed conduct that proved well suited to the nature of politics in an age of power. But the art of the double-cross, which was a shrewd policy for politicians in the modern era, was outrageous and subversive in terms of the culture of chivalry that had grown up in previous centuries.</p>
<p class="indent">As we explored earlier, the virtues of chivalry included an emphasis on extreme fidelity to oaths. This was a necessity in a society where protection was organized in exchange for personal services. The bargains upon which feudal society rested were not such that they would have reemerged spontaneously among people free to determine where their best interests lay under conditions of duress. Therefore, feudal commitments that were the basis of <span id="page_351" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="351"></span>chivalry had to be shorn up with a strong sense of honor. In that context, little could have been more subversive than Machiavelli’s suggestion that the Prince should not hesitate to lie, cheat, and steal when so doing served his interests.</p>
<p class="indent">As the twentieth century drew to a close, Machiavelli’s arguments were still being examined for their importance in understanding modern politics and various twentieth-century crimes and tyrannies. Castiglione’s work, by contrast, is all but forgotten. In a year’s time, <i class="calibre3">II Libro del Cortegiano</i> may be read from cover to cover by a handful of literature students at the graduate level and a few connoisseurs of the history of manners.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometime within the next few decades, the new megapolitics of the Information Age will antiquate <i class="calibre3">The Prince.</i> The Sovereign Individual will require a new recipe for success, one which will highly emphasize honor and rectitude in deploying resources outside the grip of the state. We can predict that such advice will not be read with pleasure by E. J. Dionne, Jr., and the other living social democrats.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">Policy Set by Customers</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">This will be especially true early in the transition, when most jurisdictions will still be lumbered with the necessity of formulating policies whose advocates can attract popular assent from a majority of the population. Later, as democracy fades away and the market for sovereignty services deepens, the market conditions that constrain “policy” will become more broadly understood.</p>
<p class="indent">What we now think of as “political” leadership, which is always conceived in terms of a nation-state, will become increasingly entrepreneurial rather than political in nature. In these conditions, the viable range of choice in putting together a “policy” regime for a jurisdiction will be effectively narrowed in the same way that the range of options open to entrepreneurs in designing a first-class resort hotel or any similar product or service is defined by what people will pay for. A resort hotel, for example, would seldom attempt to operate on terms that required guests to perform hard labor to repair and extend its facilities. Even a resort hotel owned or controlled by its employees, like the typical modern democracy, would try in vain to force customers to comply with such demands, especially after better accommodations became available. If the customers would rather play golf than do heavy labor in the hot sun, then on that question, at least, the market offers little scope for imposing arbitrary alternatives. In such conditions, presently “political” issues will recede into entrepreneurial judgments, as fragmented jurisdictions seek to discover which policy bundles will attract a viable cross-section of customers.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><span id="page_352" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="352" class="calibre2"></span><i class="calibre5">The Atrophy of Politics</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">As this becomes understood, there will be a sea change in attitudes. Populations in devolving jurisdictions will no longer expect to select from the same range of wish-fulfilling policy options that engrossed political debate in the twentieth century. With income-earning capacity more highly skewed than in the industrial era, jurisdictions will tend to cater to the needs of those customers whose business is most valuable and who have the greatest choice of where to bestow it.</p>
<p class="indent">Under such conditions, it may matter much less than we are accustomed to assume whether or not policies that are commercially optimal for a jurisdiction would appeal to the “median, voter” in a focus group.</p>
<p class="indent">In short, the commercialization of sovereignty will facilitate the control of governments by their customers. This will tend to make the opinions of noncustomers irrelevant, or less relevant, just as the opinions of Big Mac eaters about foie gras are irrelevant to the success of three-star French restaurants, like L’Arpège in Paris.</p>
