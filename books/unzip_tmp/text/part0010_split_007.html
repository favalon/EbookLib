<h2 class="h1" id="calibre_pb_7">H<span class="smallcaps1">YPOCRISY</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Beneath a “superficial crust of piety,” late-medieval society was remarkably blasphemous, irreverent, and debauched. Churches were the favorite trysting places of young men and women, and frequent gathering spots of prostitutes and vendors of obscene pictures. Historians report that “the irreverence of daily religious practice was almost unbounded.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch04en51" href="part0023_split_004.html#ch04-en51" class="calibre4">51</a></sup> Choristers hired to <span id="page_119" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="119"></span>chant for the souls of the dead commonly substituted profane words in the mass. Vigils and processions, which played a far bigger role in medieval religious practice than they do today, were nonetheless “disgraced by ribaldry, mockery and drinking.” So said late-medieval Europe’s leading theological authority, Denis the Carthusian.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch04en52" href="part0023_split_004.html#ch04-en52" class="calibre4">52</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">While such a report could be challenged as the griping of a stiff-lipped moralist, it is merely one of many accounts that paint the same picture. There is ample reason to believe that the bawdy and the sacred were frequently close companions in medieval life. Pilgrimages, for example, so often degenerated into riot and debauchery that high-minded reformers argued without success that they be suppressed. Local religious processions also provided regular occasions for mobs to vandalize, loot, and generally indulge in whatever drunken antics caught their fancy. Even when people sat still to hear mass, it was frequently not a sober experience. Prodigious quantities of wine were consumed in church, especially on festival nights. Accounts from the Council of Strasbourg show that those who “watched in prayer” on St. Adolphus Night drank 1,100 liters of wine provided by the council in honor of the saint.</p>
<p class="indent">Jean Gerson, a leading fifteenth-century theologian, reports that “the most sacred festivals, even Christmas night,” were spent “in debauchery, playing at cards, swearing and blaspheming.” When admonished for these lapses, the common people “plead the example of the nobility and the clergy, who behave in like manner with impunity.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch04en53" href="part0023_split_004.html#ch04-en53" class="calibre4">53</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">Piety and Compassion</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">The piety that rationalized the saturation of society by organized religion in the late Middle Ages served the same purpose as the “compassion” that is meant to justify the political domination of life today. The sale of indulgences to satisfy a desire for piety without morals parallels lavish welfare spending to slake the pretense of compassion without charity. It was largely immaterial whether the actual effect of received practices was to improve moral character or save souls, just as it is largely immaterial whether a welfare program actually improves the lives of the people to whom it is directed. “Piety,” like “compassion,” was an almost superstitious invocation.</p>
<p class="indent">In a time when causal relationships were scarcely understood, rituals and sacraments of the Church permeated every phase of life. “… A journey, a task, a visit, were equally attended by a thousand formalities: benedictions, ceremonies, formulas.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch04en54" href="part0023_split_004.html#ch04-en54" class="calibre4">54</a></sup> Prayers inscribed on pieces of parchment were strung like necklaces on those suffering from fevers. Malnourished girls draped locks of their hair in front of the image of St. Urban to prevent <span id="page_120" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="120"></span>further hair loss. Peasants in Navarre marched in processions behind an image of St. Peter to solicit rain during droughts.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch04en55" href="part0023_split_004.html#ch04-en55" class="calibre4">55</a></sup> People eagerly adopted these and other “ineffective techniques to allay anxiety when effective ones were not available.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch04en56" href="part0023_split_004.html#ch04-en56" class="calibre4">56</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">Two Wrongs to Make a Rite</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">People were so firmly convinced of the miraculous qualities attaching to the relics of saints that the death of any notably pious person frequently occasioned a mad rush to divide up the body. After Thomas Aquinas died in the monastery of Fossanuova, the monks there decapitated and boiled his body in order to secure control of his bones. When St. Elizabeth of Hungary was lying in state, “a crowd of worshippers came and cut or tore strips of the linen enveloping her face; they cut off the hair, the nails, even the nipples.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch04en57" href="part0023_split_004.html#ch04-en57" class="calibre4">57</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">Piety Without Virtue</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">The medieval mind saw the saints and their relics as part of the arsenal of faith in a world that was colder in winter, darker at night, and more desperate in the face of disease than any reader of this book will have been likely to know. More emphatically than in the modern period, people in the Middle Ages believed that demons were real, that God actively intervened in the world, and that prayer, penance, and pilgrimages earned divine favor.</p>
<p class="indent">To say simply that people believed in God could convey neither the intensity of their adherence nor the apparent ease with which medieval piety seemed to bed down with sin. Belief in the efficacy of rites, rituals, and sacraments was so pervasive that it perhaps inevitably undercut the urgency of behaving in a virtuous way. For any sin or spiritual defect there was a remedy, a penance that would clear the slate, in what came to be a “mathematics of salvation.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch04en58" href="part0023_split_004.html#ch04-en58" class="calibre4">58</a></sup> Religion became so all-pervasive that its sincerity necessarily began to flag. As Huizinga put it, “Religion penetrating all relations in life means a constant blending of the spheres of holy and of profane thought. Holy things will become too common to be deeply felt.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch04en59" href="part0023_split_004.html#ch04-en59" class="calibre4">59</a></sup> And so it was.</p>
