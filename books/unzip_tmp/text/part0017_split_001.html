<p class="noindent">As artificial reality and computer game technologies continue to improve, you’ll even be able to order a nightly news report that simulates the news you would like to hear. Want to watch a report showing yourself as the winner of the decathlon at the Olympics? No problem. It could be tomorrow’s lead story. You’ll see any story you wish, true or false, unfold on your television/computer with greater verisimilitude than anything that NBC or the BBC can now muster.</p>
<p class="indent">We are rapidly moving to a world where information will be as completely liberated from the bounds of reality as human ingenuity can make it. Certainly, this will have tremendous implications for the quality and character of the information you receive. In a world of artificial reality and instantaneous transmission of everything everywhere, integrity of judgment and the ability to distinguish the true from the false will be even more important.</p>
<p class="indent">But this will be less of a change from our current circumstances than many people would imagine. The distinctions between true and false are commonly blurred for reasons that have been amplified by technology. We say this recognizing that many of the consequences of the Information Revolution have been liberating.</p>
<p class="indent">Technology has already begun to transcend geographic proximity and political domination. Governments can erect barriers to hinder the trade in goods, but they can do much less to halt the transmission of information. Almost every diner at any restaurant in Hong Kong is connected by cellular phone to the whole globe. The hard-line coup plotters in Moscow in August 1991 could not shut down Yeltsin’s communications because he had cellular phones.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">More Information, Less Understanding</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">As the barriers to transmission of information have fallen, there has been more of it, which is good. But there has also been more confusion about what it means. The modern technology that helps liberate information from political controls and impediments of time and place also tends to raise the value of old-fashioned judgment. The kind of insight that helps discern what is important and true from the mountain of facts and fantasies is growing in value almost daily. This is true for at least three reasons:</p>
<p class="indent">1. The very glut of information now available puts a premium on brevity. Brevity leads to abbreviation. Abbreviation leaves out what is unfamiliar. When you have many facts to digest and lots of phone calls to return, the natural desire is to make each information-processing event as concise <span id="page_361" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="361"></span>as possible. Unfortunately, abbreviated information often provides a poor foundation for understanding. The deeper and richer textures of history are precisely the parts that tend to be edited out in the twenty-five-second soundbites and misconstrued on CNN. It is much easier to convey a message that is a variation on an already understood theme than it is to explore a new paradigm of understanding. You can report a baseball or a cricket score much more easily than you can explain how baseball or cricket is played and what it means.</p>
<p class="indent">2. Rapidly changing technology is undermining the megapolitical basis of social and economic organization. As a consequence, broad paradigmatic understanding, or unspoken theories about the way the world works, are being antiquated more quickly than in the past. This increases the importance of the broad overview and diminishes the value of individual “facts” of the kind that are readily available to almost anyone with an information retrieval system.</p>
<p class="indent">3. The growing tribalization and marginalization of life have had a stunting effect on discourse, and even on thinking. Many people have consequently gotten into the habit of shying away from conclusions that are obviously implied by the facts at their disposal. A recent psychological study disguised as a public opinion poll showed that members of individual occupational groups were almost uniformly unwilling to accept any conclusion that implied a loss of income for them, no matter how airtight the logic supporting it. Given increased specialization, most of the interpretive information about most specialized occupational groups is designed to cater to the interests of the groups themselves. They have little interest in views that might be impolite, unprofitable, or politically incorrect. There is no better example of this general tendency than the broad drumbeat of views implying bright prospects for investing in the stock market. Most of that information is generated by brokerage firms, few of which will tell you that stocks are overvalued. Their income is derived from transaction business that depends on the majority of customers being ready to buy. Independent, contrary voices are seldom heard.</p>
<p class="indent">For these and other reasons, the Age of Information has not yet become the Age of Understanding. To the contrary, there has been a sharp drop-off in the rigor of public discourse. The world now could know more than at any time in the past. But there is almost no public voice left to assess the meaning of events and say what is true. This is why we have been fascinated to see the tepid interest, particularly in the U.S. media, in reporting hints of sensational corruption at high levels of the U.S. government.</p>
<p class="indent">A central theme we have wrestled with in this book is how changing technology and other “megapolitical” factors alter the “natural economy.” The “natural economy” is the Darwinian “state of nature” where outcomes <span id="page_362" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="362"></span>are determined, sometimes unfairly, by physical force. In the “natural economy,” an important strand of behavior is what biologists call “interference competition.”</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">Interference Competition</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">“Interference competitors,” as Jack Hirshleifer put it, “gain and maintain control over resources by directly fighting off or hampering their rivals.…”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en2" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en2" class="calibre4">2</a></sup> However much we may wish that human behavior were always subject to the rule of law and “other socially enforced rules of the game” (“political economy”), there is ample evidence that many people “play by the rules” only when it suits them. Hirshleifer, an authority on conflict, put it this way: “[T]he persistence of crime, war and politics teaches us that actual human affairs still remain largely subject to the underlying pressures of natural economy.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en3" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en3" class="calibre4">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">In other words, economic outcomes are determined only partly by the peaceful and law-abiding behavior of the <i class="calibre3">Homo economicus</i> described in textbooks, who honor property rights “and will not simply take what does not belong to them.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en4" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en4" class="calibre4">4</a></sup> Actual outcomes are also shaped by conflict, including overt violence. As economist Hirshleifer points out, “Even under law and government, the rational, self-interested individual will strike a balance between lawful and unlawful means of acquiring resources—between production and exchange on the one hand and theft, fraud and extortion on the other.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en5" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en5" class="calibre4">5</a></sup></p>
