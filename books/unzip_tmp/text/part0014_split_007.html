<p class="noindent">In the place of nation-states you will see, at first, smaller jurisdictions at the provincial level, and ultimately, smaller sovereignties, enclaves of various <span id="page_242" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="242"></span>kinds like medieval city-states surrounded by their hinterlands. As strange as it may seem to people, inculcated with the importance of politics, policies of these new ministates will in many cases be informed more by entrepreneurial positioning than by political wrangling. These new, fragmented sovereignties will cater to different tastes, just as hotels and restaurants do, enforcing specific regulations within their public spaces that appeal to the market segments from, which they draw their customers. This is not to say, of course, that there are not special problems arising from the organization of protection on a nomadic basis. We address these in the next chapter.</p>

<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">Noncitizens of the Pale</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">These difficulties notwithstanding, human ingenuity usually finds a way to create institutions to capture profitable opportunities, even where the demand arises from persons who can pay little. Where the potential customers are among the wealthiest persons on earth, that tendency should be all the more emphatic. Exit, or “voting with your feet,” is always an option when dated products, organizations, or even governments lose their appeal and seem to offer little prospect of immediate improvement. Consider, for example, the growth of medieval towns that served as safe havens for serfs escaping feudal subjugation. Their role may prove analogous to the role of new jurisdictions in accommodating the coming exit from nation-states. The acceptance of aliens escaping from some lord as “citizens of the pale” defied the prevailing conventions of feudal law and episcopal authority. But nonetheless it was a generally successful alternative for those who employed it, contributing importantly to weakening the grip of feudalism. As medieval historian Fritz Rorig put it, the serf of a secular lord would be “a free burgher of the town after a year and a day.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch08en15" href="part0023_split_008.html#ch08-en15" class="calibre4">15</a></sup> It is reasonable to expect new institutional refuges to spring up, upon “new legal principles,” to provide fiscal refuge to citizens of the state, much as the medieval town offered refuge to feudal subjects who lived within the shadows of its walls.</p>
<p class="indent">Economist Albert O. Hirschman, who explored the theoretical subtleties of “voting with your feet” in <i class="calibre3">Exit, Voice, and Loyalty,</i> first published in 1969, foresaw that technological advances would increase the likelihood of exit as a strategy for dealing with states in decline. He wrote, “Only as countries start to resemble each other because of the advances in communication and all-round modernization will the danger of premature and <span id="page_243" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="243"></span>excessive exits arise.…”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch08en16" href="part0023_split_008.html#ch08-en16" class="calibre4">16</a></sup> That is precisely what is happening. Information technology is rapidly diminishing many of the differences among jurisdictions, making exit a much more attractive option. Of course, “premature and excessive exits” in Hirschman’s vocabulary are understood from the point of view of what is optimal for the state being deserted. No doubt lords in medieval Europe believed that they suffered from “premature and excessive exits” of their serfs into towns where they achieved freedom.</p>
<p class="indent">To return to our earlier example, it is not as far-fetched as it might seem to suppose that there will be a number of ministates offering refuge to exiles fleeing the dying nation-states. These sovereignties will compete on terms and conditions of exile. Some, perhaps on the West Coast of North America, may well cater to people who do not smoke and are intolerant of secondhand smoke from those who do. Obviously, such regimes would not be popular with smokers. Rules banning their habit will seem an arbitrary imposition to many smokers.</p>
<p class="indent">In the industrial era of mass politics, such differences of opinion were fought out in political campaigns that ultimately forced one group or the other to abide by the wishes of the more powerful. But it is by no means essential that contentions about mutually exclusive choices be settled in a way that requires that the preferences of large numbers of people be suppressed.</p>
<p class="indent">Some individuals like to eat foie gras and others like hot dogs, and others still eat soya curd. They usually do not have to argue about their diet preferences because their culinary choices are not bound together. No one forces all to consume the same meal. Megapolitical conditions did, however, force common consumption of many kinds of collective and even private goods provided by governments in the industrial era. Why? Because there were great economic advantages to be captured by operating at a large scale. It was therefore impractical to divide sprawling jurisdictions into enclaves where everyone could have his own way, even on important items. The exclusionary approach to the provision of public goods argued by Adam Smith can be far more easily accommodated when the number of jurisdictions multiplies by ten or even a hundred times over. In the Information Age, growing numbers of sovereignties will be small enclaves rather than continental empires. Some may be North American Indian bands who will claim tax jurisdiction over their reservations and reserves much as they now claim the right to operate gambling casinos or to fish in defiance of limits.</p>
<p class="indent">Because information technology eliminates many of the drawbacks of devolving trading areas, it will be practical for the new sovereignties to operate more on the principles of clubs or affinity groups than those that governed territorial nation-states. Just as it is not crucial that every <i class="calibre3">potential</i> customer share the same taste in clothes, or watch the same television <span id="page_244" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="244"></span>programs, it will be less important than it may seem that everyone agree with affinity points that define the governing style of fragmented sovereignties.</p>
<p class="indent">Widely dispersed tastes will result in widely divergent styles of fragmented sovereignty, much as there are increasingly wide choices in clothing style or television broadcasts. Some microstates may even be linked like hotel groups in franchises, or operate together to achieve advantages in police functions and other residual services of government. Those who like clean streets and resent finding gum under tabletops will find Singapore fetching. Fans of Beavis and Butthead won’t. Those who like wild nightlife will prefer Macao or Panama, or some similar place. Customers uncomfortable with mores in one jurisdiction will be welcomed in others. While Salt Lake City may be smokeless, the new city-state in Havana, perhaps renamed Monte Cristo, will probably be shrouded in a cloud of cigar smoke.</p>

<p class="indent">A peculiar irony of the re-emergence of micro-sovereignties or “city-states” is that it may coincide with the emptying out of many cities. The large city was largely an artifact of industrialism in the West. It arose with the factory system to capture scale economies in the manufacture of products with high natural resource content.</p>
<p class="indent">When the nineteenth century opened, cities of more than 100,000 were considered huge, and outside of Asia, where population statistics were doubtful, there were no cities of more than a million persons. The largest city in the United States in 1800 was Philadelphia, with a population of 69,403. New York had just 60,489. Baltimore was the third largest city in America with 26,114 inhabitants.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch08en18" href="part0023_split_008.html#ch08-en18" class="calibre4">18</a></sup> Most of what were to become the great metropolitan cities of Europe had populations that are tiny by twentieth-century standards. London, with a population of 864,845, was probably the biggest city in the world. Paris, with 547,756, was the only other city in Europe with more than half a million inhabitants in 1801.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch08en19" href="part0023_split_008.html#ch08-en19" class="calibre4">19</a></sup> Lisbon’s population was 350,000.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch08en20" href="part0023_split_008.html#ch08-en20" class="calibre4">20</a></sup> Vienna had a population of 252,000.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch08en21" href="part0023_split_008.html#ch08-en21" class="calibre4">21</a></sup> Berlin had barely poked above 200,000 by 1819.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch08en22" href="part0023_split_008.html#ch08-en22" class="calibre4">22</a></sup> Madrid was home to 156,670.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch08en23" href="part0023_split_008.html#ch08-en23" class="calibre4">23</a></sup> The population of Brussels in 1802 was 66,297. Budapest had a population of just 61,000.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch08en24" href="part0023_split_008.html#ch08-en24" class="calibre4">24</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_245" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="245"></span>There is an obvious temptation to think that the growth of big cities is a direct function of population growth. But this is not necessarily so. Every human on earth could be packed into Texas, with each family living in its own detached house with a yard, and still have some of Texas left over. As Adna Weber argued in the classic study <i class="calibre3">The Growth of Cities in the Nineteenth Century,</i> population growth alone does not explain why people live in urban settings rather than dispersed in the countryside. In 1890, Bengal had about the same population density as England. Yet Bengal’s urban population was just 4.8 percent, while England’s was 61.7 percent.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch08en25" href="part0023_split_008.html#ch08-en25" class="calibre4">25</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Historically, cities were walled off from the countryside to keep marauders and the lower classes out. The growth of industrial employment in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries created big cities. Now the big city has become highly vulnerable to breakdown as industrialism has begun, to fade. The perfect marker of this development is Detroit, the leading industrial city of the mid-twentieth century. At one time, a large fraction of the world’s industrial output passed through Detroit. Now it is a hollowed-out shell, ridden by crime and disorder. In many blocks of downtown Detroit, one or more derelict buildings have been burned to the ground or torn down, leaving the impression that the city has survived a series of raids by World War II bombers.</p>
<p class="indent">Detroit stands as a reminder that many industrial cities are no longer viable. They will crumble away as information and ideas become more important factors imparting value than fabricating from natural resources. In many cases, the large city has already grown too large to support its own weight. To keep a metropolis functioning requires that a <span id="page_246" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="246"></span>substantial number of support systems operate effectively at large scale. The very crowding together of millions of people implies a huge jump in vulnerability to crime, sabotage, and random violence. During the industrial era, the price of policing against these risks was repaid by the high-scale economies of production.</p>
<p class="indent">In the Information Age, only cities that repay their upkeep costs by offering a high quality of life will remain viable. Persons at a distance will no longer be obliged to subsidize them. A good marker for the viability of cities is whether those living at the core of the city are richer than those on its periphery. Buenos Aires, London, and Paris will remain inviting places to live and do business long after the last good restaurant closes in South Bend, Louisville, and Philadelphia.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">Country States</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">Some city-states may prove to be merely enclaves with no cities attached. Perhaps they might be better thought of as village states or country states.</p>
<p class="indent">Natural resource endowments will be valued in different ways as well. When you can do business anywhere, you may well choose to do business <span id="page_247" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="247"></span>in a beautiful place where you can breathe deeply without inhaling too much carcinogenic pollution. Communications technologies that minimize language difficulties will make it ever easier to abide almost anywhere that the environment is attractive. Thinly populated regions with temperate climates, and a large endowment of arable land per head, like New Zealand and Argentina, will also enjoy a comparative advantage because they enjoy high standards of public health and are low-cost producers of foods and renewable products. Such products will benefit from increased demand as the living standards of billions of people in East Asia and Latin America rise.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">The Inequivalence Theorem</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">Many of the assumptions of economists about behavior are rooted in the tyranny of place. A distinct example is Ricardo’s “Equivalence Theorem,” which suggests that citizens in a country that runs huge deficits will adjust their expectations in anticipation of higher tax rates needed in the future to retire the debt. In this sense, there is an “equivalence” between financing spending by taxation and through debt. At least there was such an equivalence in the early nineteenth century when Ricardo wrote. In the Information Age, however, the rational person will not respond to the prospect of higher taxes to fund deficits by increasing his savings rate; he will transfer his domicile, or lodge his transactions elsewhere. For the same reason that producers sort among suppliers in search of the lowest costs, they will be even more strongly motivated to seek alternative suppliers of protection. The benefits of doing so will dwarf the margins to be realized by shifting to a new supplier of plastic tubes. The result to be expected is that Sovereign Individuals and other rational people will flee jurisdictions with large unfunded liabilities.</p>
<p class="indent">Cheap governments that have few liabilities and impose low costs on customers will be the domiciles of choice for wealth creation in the Information Age. This implies much more attractive prospects for doing business in areas where indebtedness is low and governments have already been restructured, such as New Zealand, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Singapore, and other parts of Asia and Latin America. These areas will also be superior platforms for doing business to unreformed, high-cost economies in North America and Western Europe.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">The Erosion of Local Price Anomalies</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">Greatly reduced information costs will obviate most local pricing advantages. Not only will buyers be able to scan an immense number of outlets in search of the lowest prices on tradable goods; they will also be able to employ remote services to shop across jurisdictional boundaries. This will <span id="page_248" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="248"></span>allow people to much more easily compare features of difficult-to-analyze products like insurance. And it will bypass restraints of trade imposed by local licensing procedures. Consequently, profit margins are likely to fall in any field where local price anomalies can be eroded by additional information and competition.</p>
