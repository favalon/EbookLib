<h2 class="h1" id="calibre_pb_2">M<span class="smallcaps1">UGGING IN THE</span> I<span class="smallcaps1">NFORMATION</span> A<span class="smallcaps1">GE</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Michelle R. Garfinkel and Stergios Skaperdas explore this in a useful book on violence, crime, and politics, <i class="calibre3">The Political Economy of Conflict and Appropriation:</i> “Individuals and groups can either produce and thus create wealth or seize the wealth created by others.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en6" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en6" class="calibre4">6</a></sup> They quote a tale of modern interference competition originally reported by the <i class="calibre3">Economist:</i> “An American businessman, recently arrived in Moscow to open an office, was met at his hotel by five men with gold watches, pistols and a print-out of his firm’s net worth. They demanded 7% of future earnings. He took the first flight to New York, where muggers are less sophisticated.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en7" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en7" class="calibre4">7</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">This tale of mugging in the Information Age owes more to new technology than the simple fact that thugs in Russia now have access to financial profiles and credit reports on their victims through the Internet.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><span id="page_363" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="363" class="calibre2"></span><i class="calibre5">Falling Decisiveness of Military Power</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">For good and for ill, by making large-scale military power less decisive, information technology has radically reduced the capacity of the nation-state to impose its authority in an unruly world. If once, as Voltaire said, God was “on the side of bigger battalions,” there appears to be less divine support with every day that passes for generating large returns to violence. Instead, we see the opposite—more evidence of diminishing returns to violence—which strongly implies that large conglomerations like the nation-state will no longer justify their huge overhead costs.</p>
<p class="indent">The most obvious evidence of the declining decisiveness of centralized power is the rise of terrorism. High-profile bombings in the United States in the mid-nineties show that even the world’s military superpower is not immune from attack.</p>
<p class="indent">Another important manifestation of falling returns to violence is the worldwide growth of gangsterism and organized crime, along with its corollary, political cronyism and corruption. They reflect a generally amoral atmosphere in which the state can coerce but not protect. As its monopoly of violence frays, new competitors edge into the scene, like the bully-boys who tried to impose their own private taxes on the American businessman in Moscow.</p>
<p class="indent">Small groups, tribes, triads, gangs, gangsters, mafias, militias, and even solitary individuals have gained increasing military effectiveness. They will exercise far more real power in the “natural economy” of the next millennium than they did in the twentieth century. Weapons that employ microchips have tended to shift the balance of power toward the defense, making decisive aggression less profitable and therefore less likely. Smart weapons, like Stinger missiles, for example, effectively neutralize much of the advantage that large, wealthy states formerly enjoyed in deploying expensive air power to attack poorer, smaller groups.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">Information War Ahead</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">Looming ahead is the widely discussed but little-understood possibility of “Information War.” It also points to diminishing returns to violence. “Logic bombs” could disable or sabotage air-traffic control systems, rail-switching mechanisms, power generators and distribution networks, water and sewage systems, telephone relays, even the military’s own communications. As societies become more dependent upon computerized controls, “logic bombs” could do almost as much damage as physical explosions.</p>
<p class="indent">Unlike conventional bombs, “logic bombs” could be detonated remotely, not just by hostile governments but by groups of free-lance computer <span id="page_364" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="364"></span>programmers, and even talented individual hackers. Note that an Argentine teenager was arrested in 1996 for repeatedly hacking into Pentagon computers. While to date hackers have not tended to tamper with computer-controlled systems in destructive ways, this is not because there are truly effective ways of stopping them.</p>
<p class="indent">When the age of Information War finally arrives, it is unlikely that its antagonists will only be governments. A company like Microsoft certainly has a greater ability to conduct Information War than 90 percent of the world’s nation-states.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">The Age of the Sovereign Individual</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">This is part of the reason why we have entitled this book <i class="calibre3">The Sovereign Individual</i>. As the scale of warfare falls, defense and protection will be mounted at a smaller scale. Therefore, they will increasingly be private rather than public goods, provided on a for-profit basis by private contractors. This is already evident in the privatization of policing in North America. One of the more rapidly growing occupations in the United States is the “security guard.” Projections indicate that the number of private security guards will increase 24 percent to 40 percent above 1990 levels by the year 2005.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en8" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en8" class="calibre4">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The privatization of policing is already a well-defined trend. Yet as Anglo-Irish guru Hamish McRae points out, this is hardly the result of any deliberate decision of government. He writes in <i class="calibre3">The World in 2020:</i></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote2">
<p class="block">No government has made a specific decision to move out of some policing tasks, nor indeed, have any moved out; the private sector has moved in. Partly as a result of the perceived failures of the police, partly as a result of other changes in society, private security firms have gradually been taking over much of the job of protecting ordinary civilians in their offices or shopping centres. As the gated communities of Los Angeles show, people are even moving some way back towards the medieval concept of a city, where the citizens live behind town walls patrolled by guards, and where access is possible only at controlled gates.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en9" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en9" class="calibre4">9</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="indent">We believe that this is only a foretaste of more comprehensive privatization of almost every function undertaken by governments in the twentieth century. Because information technology has undermined the capacity of centralized authority to project power and provide physical security for systems that operate at a large scale, the optimal size of almost every enterprise in the “natural economy” is falling.</p>
<p class="indent">To respond to this technological change will entail a massive investment <span id="page_365" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="365"></span>requirement (read opportunity) to redesign vulnerable systems with distributed rather than concentrated capabilities. If vulnerabilities of large scale are not removed, the systems that retain them will be subject to catastrophic failure.</p>
<p class="indent">Sooner or later, by default if not by design, services and products provided by large bureaucratic agencies and corporations will devolve into highly competitive markets, managed not from a “headquarters” but through a distributed, decentralized network.</p>
<p class="indent">The corporation with a headquarters that can be surrounded by pickets or sabotaged by terrorists will be vulnerable until it ultimately becomes a “virtual corporation” without a location, “dwelling in many places concurrently,” as Kevin Kelly, executive editor of <i class="calibre3">Wired</i> magazine writes in <i class="calibre3">Out Of Control</i>.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en10" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en10" class="calibre4">10</a></sup> Kelly understands that technology has changed the imperative to bring production processes under centralized control. “For most of the industrial revolution, serious wealth was made by bringing processes under one roof. Bigger was more efficient.” Now it isn’t.</p>
<p class="indent">Kelly foresees the possibility that an automobile of the future, the Upstart Car, could be designed and brought to production by as few as a dozen people collaborating in a virtual corporation.</p>
<p class="indent">In the future, excessive scale could be not only counterproductive but dangerous. Larger enterprises make more tempting targets. As practitioners of the underground economy demonstrate, one of the secrets of avoiding taxation is to avoid detection. This will be much easier for small-scale, “virtual corporations” than old-line corporations operating out of a skyscraper headquarters with their names in lights. They are bound to be more vulnerable to the attentions of “men with gold watches, pistols and a printout of the firm’s net worth,” the gangsters who will impose their own private brand of taxation in other parts of the globe as they do in Russia. Enterprises on all scales will be vulnerable to criminal shakedowns and impositions from organized criminal gangs.</p>

<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">Nature Hates Monopolies</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">As the monopoly on violence enjoyed by the “bigger battalions” breaks down, one of the first results to be expected is increasing prosperity for <span id="page_366" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="366"></span>organized crime. Organized crime, after all, provides the main competition to nation-states in employing violence for predatory purposes. Although it is impolite to say so, it should not be forgotten, as political scientist Charles Tilly reminds us, that governments themselves— “quintessential protection rackets with the advantage of legitimacy—qualify as our largest examples of organized crime.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en12" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en12" class="calibre4">12</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">If you knew nothing else about the world other than the fact that an important monopoly was breaking down, one of the simplest and surest predictions you could make is that its nearest competitors would stand to benefit most. It is therefore not a coincidence that drug cartels, gangs, mafias, and triads of various sorts are proliferating around the world.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">Sistema del Potere</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">From Russia to Japan to the United States, organized crime is a far more important factor in the operation of economies than economic textbooks would prepare you to believe. What the Sicilians call the <i class="calibre3">“sistema del potere,”</i> the “system of power,” of organized crime has an increasingly important role to play in determining how economies function.</p>
<p class="indent">European police officials report that international crime syndicates, including Russian and Italian mafias, played “a dominant role” in financing the genocidal wars that have racked the Balkans in recent years.</p>
<p class="indent">Drug traffickers have also played a key role in financing recent civil wars and insurgencies in other parts of the globe. Julio Fernandez, chief of the Spanish national police drug squad in Catalonia, says, “From 1986 to 1988, 80 percent of the heroin in Spain was carried here by Tamil Tiger guerrillas working with Pakistani residents in Barcelona or Madrid. As soon as we destroyed that network with arrests, it was replaced with Kurds from Turkey, who completely dominated it for the next two years.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en13" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en13" class="calibre4">13</a></sup> Chances are, whenever a new civil war or insurgency gets under way, the desperately poor combatants will finance their military effort by delivering drugs and laundering drug money.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">Drug-Financed Discounting</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">Organized criminal syndicate activities have placed downward pressures on prices of commodities other than drugs. At the micro level, crime syndicates subsidize apparently legitimate businesses from the spoils of criminal enterprise. They can launder drug profits and other illicit funds by selling ordinary goods below cost, thus undercutting the prices of their clean competitors and putting many out of business.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><span id="page_367" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="367" class="calibre2"></span><i class="calibre5">Yakuza Deflation</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">In Japan, the powerful Yakuza gangs played a key role in Japan’s hyperactive real estate bubble of the late 1980s. In spite of the fact that ninety thousand Yakuza make somewhere between $10.19 billion (official estimate) and $71.35 billion (estimate of Professor Takatsugu Nato) annually, a high proportion of the uncollectible loans that have threatened the solvency of Japan’s banks were made to Yakuza-backed deals.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en14" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en14" class="calibre4">14</a></sup> The deflation pressures—“price destruction,” as the Japanese call it—that have characterized Japan’s economy are a consequence.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">A Blind Eye</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">Russia’s mafiyas, as Yeltsin himself has admitted, have merged with “commercial structures, administrative agencies, interior ministry bodies, city authorities…”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en15" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en15" class="calibre4">15</a></sup> Because of the immunity the mafiyas have achieved by merging with police, they are able to enforce collection of their private taxes through blatant violence. Authoritative sources indicate that four of five Russian businesses now pay protection money. “According to some reports, local small businesses in Russia have to pay 30 to 50 percent of their profits to racketeers, not just the meager 7 percent demanded from the American businessman.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en16" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en16" class="calibre4">16</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">In 1993 there were 355,500 crimes in Russia officially designated as examples of “racketeering,” including almost “30,000 premeditated murders,” mostly gangland assassinations of businessmen. According to a former interior minister, General Viktor Yerin, “The bulk were contract killings, because of conflicts in the sphere of commercial and financial activity.” In most cases, authorities turned “a blind eye.”</p>
<p class="indent">Criminal organizations “through their control over coercion and corruption,” as economists Gianluca Fiorentini and Sam Peltzman write in <i class="calibre3">The Economics of Organized Crime,</i> play a key role in the economy.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en17" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en17" class="calibre4">17</a></sup> In theory, this influence can sometimes be beneficial because it constrains regulation and may encourage governments to improve their delivery of public goods. The presence of a powerful mafia “constrains the monopolistic role of government authorities.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en18" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en18" class="calibre4">18</a></sup> Governments in territories with powerful organized crime groups can only with great difficulty entertain policies that the mafias oppose.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">Collusion</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">In fact, it is notable how infrequently most governments are willing to directly confront the mafias that are their main competitors in the use of <span id="page_368" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="368"></span>organized coercion. In strictly economic terms, this is not surprising. The most profitable arrangement that “the elected members of the public administration” can strike is a “collusive agreement” with organized crime. Fiorentini and Peltzman note that “there has been evidence of large-scale agreements where organized crime ensures political support for groups of candidates, while the latter repay the favour through a favourable management of public procurements and the provision of public services or subsidies.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en19" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en19" class="calibre4">19</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Contrary to the impression conveyed by Hollywood, penetrating and defrauding governments now appears to be one of the main focuses of criminal organizations like the Sicilian mafia. “Most scholars think that by now the greatest business of the Sicilian mafia is precisely that of appropriating the different sources of public expenditures and of organizing frauds against the local, national and European Community schemes of subsidization.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en20" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en20" class="calibre4">20</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">Narco Republics</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">As we warned in <i class="calibre3">The Great Reckoning,</i> many governments in the world are thoroughly corrupted by drug lords. Mexico is an indisputable example. Former Mexican federal deputy attorney general Eduardo Valle Espinosa put the Mexican system in perspective in his resignation statement: “Nobody can outline a political project in which the heads of drug trafficking and their financiers are not included. Because if you do, you die.” Valle indicated that bribes make serving as a Mexican police chief so lucrative that candidates pay up to $2 million just to get hired. In a strict profit-and-loss accounting, buying a local police office can be a lucrative investment. Drug cartels are willing to pay fortunes to even low-ranking Mexican officials because the money buys them immunity from prosecution for their crimes.</p>
<p class="indent">Colombia is another country where the top rungs of government are dominated by drug lords. The U.S. authorities have recently revoked the U.S. visa of Colombian president Ernesto Samper on grounds that he knowingly received political contributions from drug dealers in exchange for favors.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">Pot Calls the Kettle Black</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">Anyone who has followed the reports in our newsletter, <i class="calibre3">Strategic Investment,</i> during the 1990s will immediately recognize the irony in the Clinton administration’s posturing about Samper. There is credible evidence that U.S. President Bill Clinton has done everything Samper is accused of, and worse. Even if you would not take our word for it, Clinton’s background is highlighted in gaudy detail in two well-researched books by authors on opposite sides of the political divide.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_369" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="369"></span>Roger Morris, who takes a generally left-wing perspective, was a national security official in the Nixon administration, as well as a senior aide to Dean Acheson, President Lyndon Johnson, and Walter Mondale. Morris has a doctorate from Harvard University. His book, <i class="calibre3">Partners in Power,</i> details a sordid past for Clinton that makes Samper seem like a Boy Scout.</p>
<p class="indent">Morris recounts Clinton’s fatherless childhood in Hot Springs, Arkansas, a center of gambling, prostitution, and organized crime to which most of his family had some connection. Clinton’s step-uncle, Raymond Clinton, to whom Bill Clinton referred as a “father figure,” was reputedly a leading “Godfather” figure in the Dixie mafia.</p>
<p class="indent">Morris alleges that Bill Clinton became a CIA recruit and spent his student days at Oxford monitoring anti-Vietnam War activists. As Morris sees things, Clinton remained a CIA asset through his period as governor, facilitating a CIA drug- and gun-running operation centered in Mena, Arkansas. Morris seems to indict the CIA as a whole for drug trafficking, rather than entertaining the possibility that Clinton threw in with a corrupt faction of the agency, which seems more probable to us. Either interpretation, however, still suggests that the main covert intelligence agency of the U.S. government either directly or indirectly participates in organized drug running on a large scale. If the CIA is not an adjunct of organized crime, it is tripping dangerously close to being so.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en21" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en21" class="calibre4">21</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">One Chance in 250,000,000</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">Nonetheless, <i class="calibre3">Partners in Power</i> contains details that would interest any student of the corruption of modern American politics. And by no means, however, are all of Morris’s fingers pointed at Bill Clinton. His wife comes in for some critical attention as well. For example, consider this excerpt from Morris’s account of Hillary Clinton’s miraculous commodity trading: “In 1995 economists at Auburn and North Florida Universities ran a sophisticated computer statistical model of the First Lady’s trades for publication in the <i class="calibre3">Journal of Economics and Statistics,</i> using all the available records as well as market data from the <i class="calibre3">Wall Street Journal</i>. The probability of Hillary Rodham’s having made her trades legitimately, they calculated, was less than one in 250,000,000.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en22" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en22" class="calibre4">22</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Morris musters many incriminating details about the drug-running and money-laundering operation that prospered in Arkansas under Clinton. “By the sheer magnitude of the drugs and money its flights generated, tiny Mena, Arkansas, became in the 1980s one of the world centers of the narcotics trade…”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en23" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en23" class="calibre4">23</a></sup> Morris quotes an intimate as testifying about Clinton that “He knew.”</p>
<p class="indent">Clinton not only knew of the cocaine smuggling but told state trooper <span id="page_370" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="370"></span>L. D. Brown, a former bodyguard whom Clinton helped to land a position with the CIA, that the drug running was not a CIA operation. “ ‘Oh, no,’ Clinton said, ‘That’s Lasater’s deal.’ ”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en24" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en24" class="calibre4">24</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Dan Lasater, convicted cocaine distributor, was one of Clinton’s major financial supporters, a man who made millions from Arkansas state business and once reportedly gave $300,000 in cash in a brown paper bag to then Kentucky Governor John Y. Brown. According to Morris, Lasater “was never merely another big donor to be paid special deference, but an extraordinary intimate whom Clinton visited regularly at his brokerage and who came to the mansion whenever he pleased.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en25" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en25" class="calibre4">25</a></sup> Morris recounts that Lasater’s driver, who frequently brought him to the mansion, was “a convicted murderer who carried a gun and was widely known to deal drugs on the side.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en26" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en26" class="calibre4">26</a></sup> According to Morris’s account, the President of the United States appears to have been on warmer terms with a drug dealer than the relationship alleged between Colombian president Ernesto Samper and the Cali cartel.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="indent">R. Emmett Tyrell, Jr., editor-in-chief of <i class="calibre3">The American Spectator,</i> is not a left liberal like Morris. But his account <i class="calibre3">Boy Clinton</i> contains many of the same details cited by Morris in painting a portrait of Clinton as a corrupt politician, intimately linked to drug dealing and other crimes. Indeed, the Prologue to <i class="calibre3">Boy Clinton</i> quotes L. D. Brown, Clinton’s former bodyguard, making the sensational allegation that Clinton was complicit in death-squad activity designed to eliminate witnesses who were knowledgeable about drug dealing at Mena.</p>
<p class="indent">Specifically, Brown testifies that he was personally dispatched to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, on June 18, 1986, with a Belgian-made F.A.L. light automatic rifle. Traveling under the alias Michael Johnson, Brown was to have shot and killed Terry Reed.</p>
<p class="indent">Reed, as you may remember, came to public attention in 1994 as the coauthor of <i class="calibre3">Compromised: Clinton, Bush and the CIA.</i> The thesis of <i class="calibre3">Compromised</i> is that the CIA has “co-opted the presidency,” and that its “black operations, like a cancer have metastasized the organs of government.” More specifically, Reed and his coauthor claim that both Clinton and Bush were deeply compromised by involvement in illegal activities in Arkansas, including drug trafficking.</p>
<p class="indent">Brown did not kill Reed, as instructed. He and Reed managed to survive <span id="page_371" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="371"></span>to tell at least part of their tales, which makes them luckier than others who were involved with Clinton, then and later. Consider the late Jerry Parks, who provided security for the Clinton-Gore headquarters in 1992 and was shot dead, in a gangland-style assassination, in September 1993. In another bizarre twist to a twisted tale, London’s <i class="calibre3">Sunday Telegraph</i> has revealed, on the basis of exclusive information provided by Parks’s widow, that Parks was hired to spy on Bill Clinton by the late Vincent Foster.</p>
<p class="indent">Why Foster wanted to compile a dossier of compromising information on Clinton is anyone’s guess. (He said he was doing it for Hillary.) But in any event it belies the official depiction of Foster as a naïve country boy, so shocked by the ruthless ways of Washington that he killed himself in despair. That never-plausible story becomes less plausible with each new revelation.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en27" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en27" class="calibre4">27</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">The Mob’s President</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">While the world as a whole draws back from the disturbing conclusion that the President of the United States is tainted by close association with organized crime and criminals, that is what the evidence suggests. Morris quotes a former U.S. Attorney who tracked organized crime figures and their interests. He claims that Clinton’s election as governor in 1984 “was the election when the mob really came into Arkansas politics, the dog-track and racetrack boys, the payoff people who saw a good thing… it went beyond our old Dixie Mafia, which was penny-ante by comparison. This was eastern and West Coast crime money that noticed the possibilities just like the legitimate corporations did.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en28" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en28" class="calibre4">28</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Apparently, others of like mind have continued to notice the possibilities with Clinton. <i class="calibre3">New York</i> magazine, following an earlier piece in <i class="calibre3">Reader’s Digest,</i> reports that “the president’s key allies in the trade-union movement are also men affiliated with what to all appearances are some of the dirtiest, most mobbed-up unions in America.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en29" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en29" class="calibre4">29</a></sup> Of particular interest is Clinton’s close relationship with Arthur Coia. Coia, who is one of Clinton’s “prime fund raisers,” is president of the Laborers International Union of North America, “one of the most flamboyantly corrupt unions in labor history.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en30" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en30" class="calibre4">30</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Apparently, the Justice Department under Mr. Clinton struck what <i class="calibre3">New York</i> describes as a “weirdly generous deal” with Coia “to keep his job in the face of compelling charges from that very same Justice Department that he is a long-time associate of organized-crime figures.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en31" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en31" class="calibre4">31</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Whether or not Terry Reed’s thesis is correct that “the CIA has co-opted the presidency,” there is obviously a strong temptation for individuals within a covert organization authorized to undertake “black operations” to indulge in Professor Hirshleifer’s rational choice of employing “unlawful means of acquiring resources.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_372" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="372"></span>Given the technological change that is reducing the decisiveness of massed military power in the world, one should perhaps expect to see increasing corruption, if not outright takeover of governments by organized criminal enterprises.</p>
<p class="indent">Hirshleifer argues, and we agree, that “the institutions of political economy can never be so perfect as to entirely displace… the underlying realities of natural economy.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en32" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en32" class="calibre4">32</a></sup> Power is devolving in the “natural economy.” This implies far-reaching shifts in the internal margins of power in society.</p>
<p class="indent">Political corruption, as Vito Tanzi shrewdly notes, “represents a privatization of the state in which its power is not shifted to the market, as privatization normally implies, but to government officials and bureaucrats.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en33" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en33" class="calibre4">33</a></sup> In effect, this has happened to the FBI and other police agencies under Clinton. The “rule of law” is becoming whatever Clinton and his cronies want it to be.</p>
<p class="indent">As of now, there seems little evidence that details of these corrupt connections will carry any weight with voters, even if they were taken up and discussed in the mass media. To the contrary. There seems to be little concern about hints that the President of the United States is complicit in drug running, money laundering, and worse.</p>
<p class="indent">This brings to mind the late Walter Lippmann’s fear that voters lacked the perception to see through what he called fictitious personalities. He thought that voters “are ill-served by flattery and adulation. And they are betrayed by the servile hypocrisy which tells them that what is true and what is false, what is right and what is wrong, can be determined by their votes.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en34" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en34" class="calibre4">34</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Lippmann perceived a “breakdown in the constitutional order” that could be “the cause of the precipitate and catastrophic decline of Western society.… We have fallen far in a short span of time.… What we have seen is not only decay—though much of the old structure is dissolving—but something which can be called an historic catastrophe.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en35" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en35" class="calibre4">35</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The problem is that political judgments seem less a response to the real world than to a pseudoreality that the general public has constructed about phenomena beyond their direct knowledge.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en36" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en36" class="calibre4">36</a></sup> But it is a mistake for you to be governed by the limits of what others see. Even if you do not give a twig whether Vincent Foster was murdered, and his murder covered up by the top police agencies and responsible officials of the U.S. government, including even the current special prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, you might want to consider evidence of the broader pattern of ties between organized criminal enterprise and the White House.</p>
<p class="indent">In the long run, political corruption at the highest levels makes nonsense of conventional celebration of the possibilities of democracy for the deliberate mastery of public problems. In the Information Age it will be much less important that government be large and powerful than that it be honest. Most <span id="page_373" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="373"></span>of the services that governments historically provided are destined to devolve into the private market in the next millennium. But it is doubtful on the evidence from around the world whether you can long depend upon a corrupted system with corrupt leaders for the security of your family and investments.</p>
<p class="indent">As Morris says, “[T]he Clintons are not merely symptomatic, but emblematic of the larger bipartisan system at its end-of-century dead end.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en37" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en37" class="calibre4">37</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Vito Tanzi, in his essay on corruption, shows that “the only way to deter corruption is to reduce significantly the scale of public intervention.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch11en38" href="part0023_split_011.html#ch11-en38" class="calibre4">38</a></sup> The Information Revolution will significantly reduce “the scale of public intervention” and on that basis holds out hope for a rebirth of morality and honesty. The other obvious implication of the Information Revolution for morality is an increased vulnerability that comes with the possibility of cybercommerce and virtual corporations communicating with unbreakable encryption. Internal thieves within an organization, even a virtual organization, will be more difficult to detect and it will be all but impossible to recover money that is stolen or received covertly for selling trade secrets, patents, or other valuable economic assets.</p>
<p class="indent">Crime pays, and many find it attractive to supplement lawful, productive pursuits with unlawful, predatory ones. Unlike the usual situation that prevailed in Western societies through most of the past two centuries, criminals are not merely misfits, without social standing. When crime pays, you tend to get a better class of criminal because little social odium attaches to crime. The Sicilian Mafia, for example, along with many drug dealers who employ local labor at inflated rates, command respect and popular support on their home turf.</p>
