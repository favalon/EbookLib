<p class="noindent">In the late nineteenth century a number of economists, of whom William Stanley Jevons was the most distinguished in England, started to develop mathematical economics. One of the first to apply probability theory to a major social question was the German economist Otto Ammon, whose work was first translated into English by Carlos C. Closson in an article in the <i class="calibre3">Journal of Political Economy</i> in 1899. The article was entitled “Some Social Applications of the Doctrine of Probability.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch08en4" href="part0023_split_008.html#ch08-en4" class="calibre4">4</a></sup> One might suppose that such an article was now of purely antiquarian interest. In fact, it deals with an economic problem that is again coming to the fore, and deals with it in what is still a stimulating way.</p>
<p class="indent">Otto Ammon was interested in the distribution of ability in society, and its relationship to the distribution of income and status. He took as his starting point the probable occurrence of total scores from four dice, each with six sides. Out of 1,296 possible throws, some totals will occur much more often than others.</p>

<p class="noindent">It is immediately apparent that high and low scores are both comparatively rare. There are two possible totals, but the top four of these only occur thirty-five times out of the 1,296, and the bottom four only occur thirty-five times. The middle seven group of scores can be expected to occur 884 times; <span id="page_229" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="229"></span>the middle third of possible scores is the result in more than two-thirds of all throws. This produces the characteristic crowding toward the center of probability theory.</p>
<p class="indent">Otto Ammon argued that this random distribution of throws of the dice was matched by the distribution of human abilities. He was writing before the development of intelligence testing and IQs, and relied on the earlier work on intelligence of Francis Galton. Ammon did not consider that social utility, or success in life, depended simply on intelligence. He listed “three groups of mental traits which are largely decisive in the place which a man will occupy in life.” These were:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote2">
<p class="block">1. <i class="calibre3">Intellectual traits;</i> among which I included all that belong to the rational side of man-power of quick comprehension, memory, power, of judgement, power of invention, and whatever also belongs to this field.</p>
<p class="block">2. <i class="calibre3">Moral traits;</i> namely, self control, will power, industry, perseverance, moderation, regard for family obligations, honesty and the like.</p>
<p class="block">3. <i class="calibre3">Economic traits;</i> such as business ability, organizing talent, technical skill, caution, clever calculation, foresight, thrift and so on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">To these mental traits he added:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote2">
<p class="block">4. <i class="calibre3">Bodily traits;</i> power to work, endurance, power of undergoing exertions and of resisting excitements of every kind, vigour, good, health, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="indent">In Otto Ammon’s view, the probable distribution of these qualities of intelligence, character, talent, and body were similar to those of scores on the dice. He went further and argued that there were, in fact, many more than four variables, and that they varied in more than six degrees. If instead of throwing four dice, one throws eight, then there are no less than 1,679,616 possible throws, yet the highest score, forty-eight, can still only be expected to occur once. The man or woman who scores very highly in all the factors that determine the place in life is much rarer than the probability of throwing four sixes would suggest; perhaps as rare as throwing eight sixes. Yet, Ammon notes, a mixture of high and low scores in these human qualities may produce “persons of unbalanced, inharmonious gifts, who, in spite of some brilliant qualities, cannot successfully meet the tests of life.”</p>

<p class="noindent">Ammon then turns to the distribution of incomes. Of course, the statistics of the 1890s were much less adequate than they would be now, but German bureaucracy was already well developed, and Otto Ammon found in Saxony, Prussia, Baden, and other German states income curves that he thought were similar, both to his perceived distribution of human ability and to the probabilities of the dice. He found similar figures in Charles Booth’s <i class="calibre3">Life and Labour of the People of London</i> (1892). Indeed, Booth’s social distribution does look much as one might expect from Ammon’s probability theory. Booth found in London 25 percent who were poor or worse, 51.5 percent who were comfortable, and 15 percent who were well-to-do, or better; if one takes the two lowest of Booth’s categories they come to 9.5 percent. It was common before the welfare states of the twentieth century to speak of those who were least well off as the “submerged tenth.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch08en5" href="part0023_split_008.html#ch08-en5" class="calibre4">5</a></sup> The two highest of Booth’s categories come to 7 percent.</p>
<p class="indent">From all this, Otto Ammon drew a number of interesting conclusions. He thought that people’s abilities, broadly defined, determined their place in society and their income. He believed that high abilities naturally result in people rising in income and social position. “Like a lonely mountain peak, or rather, like the spire of a cathedral, rise the men of high talent and of genius above the broad mass of mediocrity,…” He also believed that the “true form of the so-called social pyramid is that of a somewhat flat onion or turnip.” This turnip has a narrow stem above and a narrow root beneath. Such a social turnip is preferable as a metaphor to the social pyramid because, like modern industrial society, it has its mass in the middle while the pyramid has its mass at the bottom.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">The Shape of the Turnip</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">Modern industrial societies are indeed all turnips, with a small wealthy and upper-professional class at the top, a larger middle class, and a minority poor class at the bottom. Relative to the middle, both the extremes are small. In modern London, if not in Washington, there are certainly more millionaires than homeless.</p>
<p class="indent">All of this is intriguing, but the immediate interest of Ammon’s work lies in the major long-term shift we are experiencing in the relations, financial and political, between the top and the middle. The skills needed in the Factory Age, which is now passing, are undeniably different from those demanded by the Information Age. Most people could master the skills required for operating the machines of the mid-twentieth century, but those jobs have now been replaced by smart machines which, in effect, control <span id="page_231" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="231"></span>themselves. A whole arena of low- and middle-skill employment has already disappeared. If we are correct, this is a prelude to the disappearance of most employment and the reconfiguration of work in the spot market.</p>
