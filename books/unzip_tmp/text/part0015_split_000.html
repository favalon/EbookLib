In the past there were local loyalties to place and clan and tribe, obligations, to lord or landlord, dynastic or territorial wars, but primary loyalties were to religion, God or god-king, possibly to emperor, to a civilization as such.

<p class="noindent"><i class="calibre3"><a href="http://www.ibm.com" class="calibre4">http://www.ibm.com</a></i> To say that the “world is getting smaller” is an informing figure of speech, reinforced by authorities as prestigious as IBM’s advertising agency. Their “Solutions for a small planet” multicultural commercials for the Internet remind sports fans who may fail to realize it on their own that the terms of relations between individuals in widely dispersed jurisdictions have been changed by technology. We refer to the distinguished historian William McNeill for a useful footnote on the implications. He writes, “Continuing intensification of communications and transport, instead of favoring national consolidation, has begun to work in a contrary sense, inasmuch as its range transcends existing political and ethnic boundaries.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch09en2" href="part0023_split_009.html#ch09-en2" class="calibre4">2</a></sup> As the world “becomes smaller” and communications improve, the <span id="page_259" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="259"></span>accidental and “intrinsically absurd” claims of nations and nationalism are bound to weaken.</p>
