<p class="noindent">Like the late Christopher Lasch, objectors will not only complain that information technology destroys jobs; they will also complain that it negates democracy because it allows individuals to place their resources outside the reach of political compulsion. For this reason, the reactionaries of the new millennium will find the financial privacy facilitated by information technology especially threatening. They will recoil from the prospect that income and capital taxation would truly depend upon “voluntary compliance.” They will support novel and even drastic means of squeezing resources out of anyone who appears to be prosperous, such as “presumptive taxation” and holding of wealthy persons to outright ransom.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">Community Property</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">Hints of what is to come are near the surface as we write. Early evidence that the capacity of governments to control international markets is slipping away offends those who believe that individuals are, by right, assets of nation-states. They want to enforce their ability to treat the citizens of a country as assets, not as customers. The reactionaries believe that all income should be considered revenues of the community, meaning that it should be at the disposal of the state.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch10en26" href="part0023_split_010.html#ch10-en26" class="calibre4">26</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">We have already discussed arguments advanced by Lasch in <span id="page_353" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="353"></span><i class="calibre3">Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy.</i> But his is not the only diatribe in support of the nation-state. Harvard University political theorist Michael Sandel argues in <i class="calibre3">Democracy’s Discontent</i> that “Democracy today is not possible without a politics that can control global economic forces, because without such control it won’t matter who people vote for, the corporations will rule.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch10en27" href="part0023_split_010.html#ch10-en27" class="calibre4">27</a></sup> In other words, the state must retain its parasitic power over individuals, in order to assure that political outcomes can diverge from market outcomes. Otherwise collective decisions to compel diseconomic outcomes would be meaningless.</p>
<p class="indent">In our view, Sandel’s lament, like that of Lasch, is no more than half right. We concede that democracy will lose much of its importance if governments lack the power to compel individuals to behave as politicians insist. This is obvious. Indeed, democracy as it has been known in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is destined to disappear. But Sandel misses the real importance of the triumph of markets over compulsion. His invocation of “corporate rule” as a danger attendant upon the collapse of the nation-state is strikingly anachronistic.</p>
<p class="indent">Corporations will hardly be in a position to rule the markets of the new global economy. Indeed, as we have suggested, it is far from obvious that corporations will even continue to exist in their familiar modern form. Far from it. Firms are almost bound to be transformed in the megapolitical revolution that comes with the introduction of the Information Age. As we have previously discussed, microprocessing will alter the “information costs” that help determine the “nexus of contracts” that define firms. As economists Michael C. Jensen and William H. Meckling suggest, corporations are merely one legal form that provides “a nexus for a set of contracting relationships among individuals.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch10en28" href="part0023_split_010.html#ch10-en28" class="calibre4">28</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Whether the corporation can even survive, much less “rule” as “a domain of bureaucratic direction that is shielded from market forces,” is itself likely to be determined, in the words of economists Louis Putterman and Randall S. Kroszner, by “the completeness of market forces and the ability of market forces to penetrate intrafirm relationships.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch10en29" href="part0023_split_010.html#ch10-en29" class="calibre4">29</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">As we argued earlier, it is doubtful that firms will be able to survive the increasing penetration of market forces into what have heretofore been “intrafirm relationships.” As a result, firms will tend to dissolve as information technology makes it more rewarding to rely upon the price mechanism and the auction market to undertake tasks that need doing rather than having them internalized within a formal organization. As information technology increasingly automates the production process, it will take away part of the <i class="calibre3">raison d’être</i> of the firm, the need to employ and motivate managers to monitor individual workers.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><span id="page_354" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="354" class="calibre2"></span><i class="calibre5">“Why Are There Firms?”</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the question “Why are there firms?” is not as trivial as it may seem on casual observation. Microeconomics generally assumes that the price mechanism is the most effective means of coordinating resources for their most valued uses. As Putterman and Kroszner observe, this tends to imply that organizations like firms have no inherent “economic <i class="calibre3">raison d’être</i>”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch10en30" href="part0023_split_010.html#ch10-en30" class="calibre4">30</a></sup> In this sense, firms are mainly artifacts of information and transaction costs, which information technologies tend to reduce drastically.</p>
<p class="indent">Therefore, the Information Age will tend to be the age of independent contractors without “jobs” with long-lasting “firms.” Equally, when economic success depends upon talented individuals, they may receive outsized pay and extravagant bonuses to provide their services, much as professional athletes and movie stars command huge rewards for their talents. In any event, as technology lowers transaction costs, the very process that will enable individuals to escape from domination by politicians will also prevent “rule by corporations.” Corporations will compete with “virtual corporations” from across the globe to a degree that will disturb and threaten all but a few. Most corporations as institutions will be lucky to survive intensified competition as markets become more complete.</p>
<p class="indent">The consequence to be expected is not that individuals will be at the mercy of corporations. To the contrary. Corporations, per se, will have no more power to rig markets than politicians. It is rather that individuals will finally be free to determine their own destinies in a truly free market, ruled neither by big governments nor corporate hierarchies.</p>
<p class="indent">This erosion of transaction costs will also put the lie to recently fashionable notions of “stakeholder capitalism.” Such notions, dear to Tony Blair of Britain’s Labour Party as well as some within Bill Clinton’s entourage, are predicated upon the ability of the state to manipulate the corporation. Socialism having collapsed, interventionists now dream of achieving the ends of socialism through more market-efficient means by heavily regulating the firm. This new redistributive theory holds that the management, shareholders, employees, and “community” are all “stakeholders” of firms. The argument is that they all derive benefits from long-lasting firms, and even depend upon these benefits. Therefore, regulation ought to protect the stakes that managers, employees, and local taxing authorities have in the continuation of their historic relations with the firms.</p>
<p class="indent">“Stakeholder capitalism” is a doctrine that ultimately presupposes not only an ability of the state to manipulate the decision-making of corporations, but even more basically presupposes the existence of corporations as long-standing organizations capable of functioning independently of price signals in the auction market.</p>
<p class="indent">We suspect that the deepening of markets will not only diminish the taxing <span id="page_355" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="355"></span>capacity of the nation-state, it will also erode the capacity of politicians to impose their will arbitrarily upon the owners of resources by regulation. In a world where jurisdictional advantages will be subject to market tests, and many local markets will be opened to competition from anywhere, it is hardly to be expected that local “communities” will have many effective ways of isolating favored firms from global competitive pressures. Therefore, they will have few ways of assuring that corporations lumbered with higher costs (for example, to retain unnecessary employees and management personnel, and keep unneeded facilities open to accommodate local political pressures) will be able to offset those costs and stay in business. In the Industrial Age, politicians could close markets and restrict entry to a few favored firms to meet employment and other objectives. In the future, when information will be freely tradable anywhere on the globe, the power of governments to insulate local businesses from global competitive pressures will be minimal.</p>
<p class="indent">Neither is it likely that calls for a “new social contract” focused on a so-called independent or volunteer sector to absorb the time of otherwise unemployed or marginalized workers “in the community” will prove viable.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch10en31" href="part0023_split_010.html#ch10-en31" class="calibre4">31</a></sup> Jeremy Rifkin imagines “a new partnership between the government and the third sector to rebuild the social economy.… Feeding the poor, providing basic health care services, educating the nation’s youth, building affordable housing and preserving the environment…”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch10en32" href="part0023_split_010.html#ch10-en32" class="calibre4">32</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">The Eclipse of Public Goods</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">Of course, the apologists for coercion will argue that the waning of state power will lead to an inability to procure or enjoy public goods. This is unlikely, both for competitive and other reasons. For one thing, with locational advantages mostly dissipated by technology, jurisdictions that fail to provide essential public goods, such as maintenance of law and order, will rapidly lose customers. In the most extreme failures, such as those already evidenced in Somalia, Liberia, Rwanda, and the former Yugoslavia, hordes of penniless refugees are likely to spill over borders seeking more satisfactory provision of law and order. But these extreme examples of desertion, or voting with one’s feet, will differ only by their urgency from straightforward jurisdictional shopping. In any event, corporations will force local jurisdictions to meet the needs of their customers.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">“Competitive Territorial Clubs”</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">This is more than merely a theory, as articulated first by economist Charles Tiebout in 1956.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch10en33" href="part0023_split_010.html#ch10-en33" class="calibre4">33</a></sup> As economist Fred Foldvary has documented in <i class="calibre3">Public Goods and Private Communities: The Market Provision of Social Services,</i> <span id="page_356" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="356"></span>there is no essential reason that social services and many public goods must be provided by political means. Foldvary’s examples, among others, also confirm the controversial theorem of Nobel Prize-winning economist Ronald Coase that “government intervention is not needed to resolve externality issues,” such as problems of pollution.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch10en34" href="part0023_split_010.html#ch10-en34" class="calibre4">34</a></sup> Entrepreneurs can provide collective goods by market means. Many already do so now in real world communities. Foldvary’s case studies show how the privatization of communities can result in new mechanisms for providing and financing public goods and services.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch10en35" href="part0023_split_010.html#ch10-en35" class="calibre4">35</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">The Road to Prosperity</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">Microtechnology itself will facilitate new means of financing and regulating the provision of goods heretofore treated as public goods. In retrospect, some of these goods will prove to have been private goods in disguise. Highways represent a key example. So long as congestion was a minor problem, roads and highways could be treated as if they were public goods, albeit subject to the criticisms leveled by Adam Smith that they disproportionally benefit those living nearby at the expense of those in remote regions who are dragooned into paying for them while enjoying few of the benefits.</p>
<p class="indent">In the Information Age, it will be technologically feasible to impose tolls, including congestion fees, that accurately price access to highways, runways, and other infrastructure without interrupting traffic flow. Thus the provision transportation infrastructure could be discretely privatized and financed directly by those who use the service. Economist Paul Krugman estimates that market pricing of U.S. transportation infrastructure would add from $60 billion to $100 billion annually to GDP in the United States, while improving the efficiency of resource use and reducing pollution.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch10en36" href="part0023_split_010.html#ch10-en36" class="calibre4">36</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Furthermore, it is not to be forgotten that the most costly part of what modern nation-states do—redistributing income—is not the provision of a public good at all, but the provision of private goods at public expense. “Public expense” here is a euphemism for “at the expense of those who pay the taxes.”</p>
<p class="indent">What of a genuine public good, like the provision of a military force capable of deterring attack by a great power? Such a force has traditionally been expensive. Obviously, as we have already explored, a government that lacks an unchecked ability to confiscate the incomes and property of its citizens would be unable to finance participation in another great power conflict like World War II.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet this fiscal limit poses less of a threat than the reactionaries will pretend, for the simple reason that there will be no more conflicts like World War II. The very technology that is liberating individuals will see to that.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><span id="page_357" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="357" class="calibre2"></span><i class="calibre5">Up from Politics</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">Instead of leaving the quality and character of such services to the mercy of politics, “governments” can be run entrepreneurially and converted into what Foldvary describes as “competitive territorial clubs.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch10en37" href="part0023_split_010.html#ch10-en37" class="calibre4">37</a></sup> We suspect that ultimately, the decision-making process by which such “competitive territorial clubs” are organized will mean much less than their success in meeting market tests of performance. Today, few consumers care when they buy a product or service whether the firm that sells it is a sole proprietorship, a limited liability company, or a corporation controlled by outside directors nominated by pension plans. Equally, we doubt that the rational consumer of sovereignty services in the Information Age will care whether Singapore is a mass democracy or a proprietorship of Lee Kwan Yew.</p>
