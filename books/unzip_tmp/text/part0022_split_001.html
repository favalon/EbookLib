<p class="noindent">If you enjoyed this book, you may enjoy reading <i class="calibre3">Strategic Investment,</i> the private financial advisory service edited by James Dale Davidson and Lord Rees-Mogg.</p>
<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3">Strategic Investment</i> offers readers continuing insights into the emergence of the Information economy, along with advice about ways to profit from geopolitical developments.</p>
<p class="indent">Time after time, <i class="calibre3">Strategic Investment</i> has scooped the world in forecasting headlines before they happened. In its very first issue in 1984, <i class="calibre3">Strategic Investment</i> pinpointed a little-known member of the Soviet Politburo—Mikhail Gorbachev. Before Gorbachev had even assumed power, <i class="calibre3">Strategic Investment</i> obtained an interview with him and forecast that he and his wife would become international celebrities, pull back Soviet troops from around the globe, and seek cooperation rather than confrontation with the West.</p>
<p class="indent"><i class="calibre3">Strategic Investment</i> analyzed the pending fall of the Berlin Wall in February 1989, ten months before the bulldozers actually broke through the Wall. Years before the banking crisis, the S&amp;L bankruptcies, and the real estate <span id="page_402" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="402"></span>bust became news, <i class="calibre3">Strategic Investment</i> told readers what to expect. Among other <i class="calibre3">Strategic Investment</i> bull’s-eyes; the 1987 stock market plunge, the collapse of oil prices in 1986, the ditching of apartheid in South Africa, the 1990 crash of the Japanese stock market, the rout of Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War, and the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>
