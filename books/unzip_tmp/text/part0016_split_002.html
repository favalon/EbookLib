<p class="noindent">When megapolitical conditions change in a big way, as they are changing now, the organization of government inevitably changes as well. In fact, the form of representative government has traditionally been an artifact of the distribution of raw power. This is shown by the very fact that representatives are chosen on a geographic basis, rather than in some other way.</p>
<p class="indent">Think about it. In principle, a legislature would be just as representative if its members were chosen according to any arbitrary division of the population. Parliamentary ridings or congressional districts could be based on birthdays, or even alphabetical constituencies. Everyone born on January 1 could vote from one list of candidates. Those born on January 2 from another. Or every person whose name began with “Aa” to “AT” could choose among one list of candidates. Those whose names began with “Ag” would chose among another. And so on.</p>
<p class="indent">No such system exists now for several reasons. A first and sufficient reason is that it was technologically impractical in the eighteenth century. But even more important is the fact that birthday or alphabetical constituencies would not have reflected or even approximated the distribution of raw power that the vote had to manifest at that time. Persons who shared no more than birthdays or the first few letters of their names in common would have been and still would be extremely hard to organize into any coherent power base.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">Why Do Geographic Cross Sections Count More?</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">The vote really did begin as a proxy for a military contest. And so it remains, if only in a veiled way. Such contests can be organized along geographic lines, and more rarely, along kinship or religious lines. They cannot be organized on the basis of birthdays or first initials. Nor can they be organized effectively according to occupations, except where occupations are confined within hereditary guilds, like the castes in India, or cluster locally the way farmers do in Iowa.</p>
<p class="indent">The whole point of current formulas of representation is that they mobilize interests that are vested geographically, rather than along some other dimension. Historically, the key to military success was to control territory. All military threats have formed locally. Representative systems are geared to provide a different venue for the expression of that power. The fact that they inevitably tend to promote local vested interests is an artifact of the formula of representation. Geographic constituencies induce representatives to target favors for special groups at the expense of the common interests that all residents of a country share.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><span id="page_332" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="332" class="calibre2"></span><i class="calibre5">New Possibilities Ahead</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">As analysis by Public Choice economists has shown, apparently minor shifts in the way an election is structured, or the way the vote is calculated, have large and predictable consequences in altering the outcome.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch10en7" href="part0023_split_010.html#ch10-en7" class="calibre4">7</a></sup> This is why serious students of politics today have to be serious students of constitutions. And it is one of the considerations that led us to look beyond constitutions to the ultimate metaconstitution as determined by the prevailing megapolitical factors of a given environment.</p>
<p class="indent">Technological change has already swept away some of the foundations for confining the vote to geographic constituencies. When modern representative systems emerged in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, almost all communications were local. Most people lived and died within a few miles of where they were born, and the whole of their commerce and communication was conducted locally. Today there is instantaneous communication worldwide. You can do business with someone five thousand miles away almost as easily as with a neighbor. To an increasing extent, the economy is transcending geographic limitations. Society is far more mobile.</p>
<p class="indent">And so is wealth in the Information Age. Unlike a steel mill, a computer program cannot easily be held hostage to the local political process. A steel mill can scarcely be moved when legislators determine to tax it or regulate its owners. A computer program can be transmitted by modem at the speed of light anywhere in the world. The owner can pack his 486 laptop computer and fly away. This, too, undermines the megapolitical foundations of geographic constituencies.</p>
<p class="indent">A major difficulty that all representative democratic systems share in light of our analysis is that their geographic constituencies are bound to overrepresent the vested interests of industrial-era enterprises. The “losers” or “left-behinds” are perfect constituents, geographically concentrated and politically needy. The history of industrial democracy confirms this. “Winners” from new industries were chronically underrepresented in legislative deliberations even in the high tide of the Industrial Age in the 1930s.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch10en8" href="part0023_split_010.html#ch10-en8" class="calibre4">8</a></sup> The tendency of politicians to represent the existing, established competitors, not the new enterprises that might come into being or the potential customers of new enterprises, is probably an inherent feature of representative government. As Mancur Olson argued in <i class="calibre3">The Rise and Decline of Nations,</i> long-lived industries tend to develop more effective “distributional coalitions” to lobby and struggle over political booty.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch10en9" href="part0023_split_010.html#ch10-en9" class="calibre4">9</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">This problem is magnified immeasurably when it comes to the economy of the Information Age. The more creative participants in the new economy are geographically distributed. Therefore, they are unlikely to form a sufficient concentration to gain the attention of legislators, the way that salmon <span id="page_333" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="333"></span>fishers in Scotland or wheat farmers in Saskatchewan do. Indeed, many of the dynamic personalities of the new economy are unlikely to be citizens of even the most encompassing jurisdiction. Thus they will have little “voice” in the legislative deliberations of representative democracies. As a telling example, consider the disreputable efforts of American math Ph.D.s to block foreign mathematicians from taking jobs in the United States.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch10en10" href="part0023_split_010.html#ch10-en10" class="calibre4">10</a></sup> Their xenophobic representations to Congress to block employers from hiring on the basis of merit are all too likely to be heeded. The antiquated geographic representation left over from the Industrial Age takes no heed of the foreign mathematicians, or any other crucial contributors to prosperity who are not voters.</p>

<p class="indent">Few have begun to think in a concerted way about the consequences of technological change in undermining industrialism and altering income distributions. Obviously, democracy is not likely to be much more than a recipe for legalized parasitism if incomes diverge as widely as they may in the information economy. Fewer still have noticed the implied incompatibility between some of the institutions of industrial government and the megapolitics of postindustrial society. Whether these contradictions are explicitly acknowledged or not, however, their consequences will become increasingly obvious as examples of political failure compound around the world. Institutions of government that emerged in the modern period reflect the megapolitical conditions of one or more centuries ago. They survived the transition from agrarian society to urban industrialism. But the Information Age may require new mechanisms of representation to avoid chronic dysfunction and even Soviet-style collapse.</p>
<p class="indent">You can expect to see crises of misgovernment in many countries as political promises are deflated and governments run out of credit and institutional support. Ultimately, new institutional forms will have to emerge that are capable of preserving freedom in the new technological conditions, while at the same time giving expression and life to the common interests that individuals share.</p>
<p class="indent">All this points to the end of mass democracy as we have known it in the <span id="page_334" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="334"></span>twentieth century. The question is, What will take its place? If the only alternative to mass democracy were dictatorship in which the individual has no say in his destiny, then one might be tempted to join the neo-Luddites’ “revolt against the future.”</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">New Institutions</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">Happily, however, dictatorship is not the sole alternative to mass democracy. Information technology facilitates choice. Instead of collective choice within the constrained setting of “mass production, mass consumption, mass education, mass media, mass entertainment, and all the rest,” information technology will facilitate genuine, consumer choice of customized sovereignty services. This will be possible because operating at a mass scale will no longer be imperative. We believe that the technology of the Information Age will give rise to new forms of governance—just as the Agricultural Revolution and, later, the industrial era brought forth their own distinctive forms of social organization.</p>
<p class="indent">What might such new institutions be? To understand, forget anything you read in misnamed “political science” texts. The new institutions of governance for the Information Age will trespass the boundaries of conventional thinking. The progress toward such institutions of the new age has already begun. They are little-recognized improvisations for restructuring underutilized assets, the benefits of sovereignty. The world’s nation-states, anxiously looking over their shoulders at secession movements and the powerful forces of devolution, have clubbed together to form the strongest border-fixing cartel that they can possibly enforce. While the number of new states in the world has increased in the 1990s, this happened mainly in two clusters, thanks to the collapse of multiethnic Communist dictatorships in the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. It is notable that other leading nation-states, including the United States, maneuvered to preserve the Soviet Union for as long as possible. And few governments welcomed the breakup of Yugoslavia. The independence of the former Yugoslav republics was recognized only after secessionists had wrested control that they could enforce through their own military efforts. The leading powers were content to see unarmed or poorly armed separatists slaughtered by their Serb tormentors. Even faraway China, a powerful nation-state with no direct interest in preserving the rump of Yugoslavia, vigorously opposed efforts to achieve self-determination for oppressed ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Ironically, this border-fixing fetish is more likely to dictate the path of devolution to fragmented sovereignty than to actually forestall devolution. The fierce resistance of vulnerable nation-states across the globe to overt secession and political disaggregation makes recognized sovereignty a valuable form of <span id="page_335" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="335"></span>transcendental capital that can be voluntarily fragmented and sublet by the states possessing it.</p>
<p class="indent">An example of how sovereignty can be voluntarily fragmented to create essentially private, tax-free jurisdiction is the Agulhas Bay Concession Free Zone, comprising fifty square kilometers of the island of Principe off the coast of West Africa. Although the territory remains within the borders of the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Principe, the administration of the zone is privatized. Governance there is determined according to contract administered by WADCO, the West African Development Corporation Ltd., a private company chartered in South Africa. The language of record in the zone is not the official Tomean tongue, Portuguese, but English. The currency of record is not the Tomean local Monopoly money, the dobra, but the globe’s money, the U.S. dollar. Security is provided not by police forces of the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Principe, but by private police employed by WADCO. São Tomean commercial law is inapplicable to commercial dealings within the zone, and São Tomean courts have no jurisdiction. All disputes must be settled by transnational arbitration, under the Paris ICC rules. With a few tightly regulated and trivial exceptions, São Tomean taxes do not apply within the zone, nor do official monopolies. Telecommunications, for example, are automatically deregulated within the zone. Subject to the payment of rent and adherence to other terms of the concession, WADCO is entitled to automatically and repetitively renew its lease on private, fragmented sovereignty for terms of fifty years, from the first renewal date, 2047.</p>
<p class="indent">What-WADCO has achieved in São Tomé and Principe can and will be matched by others in many different jurisdictions. One of the true pioneers of twenty-first-century development, Joaquin Aguirre has created a similar zone of private sovereignty in the Central Aguirre Portuaria, in eastern Bolivia. Aguirre, a multimillionaire, novelist, and inventor, a cofounder of the United Nations, and a former Senator of the Bolivian Republic, is a pioneer many times over. Half a century after he helped to found the United Nations, Aguirre is now a prototype for the Sovereign Individual of the twenty-first century. His Zona Franca, which is free of most Bolivian taxes, duties, and regulatory impositions, points the way toward the new form of privatized city-state which will increasingly be achieved by successful individuals in the Information Age. It also demonstrates conclusively that the lives of the masses, so often eulogized by the apologists of big government, can be dramatically improved by the economic development catalyzed by free trade zones such as that launched by Señor Aguirre. As time passes, the number of de facto city states in the world will multiply significantly. Indeed, if you achieve sufficient financial independence as an individual, you will be able to achieve ultimate independence, like Joaquin Aguirre. <span id="page_336" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="336"></span>In the event that no one else’s piece of fragmented, commercialized sovereignty offers you a comfortable home base, you can launch your own proprietary ministate, as independent as any dukedom of the Middle Ages. Instead of playing tug-of-war with demagogues and political hacks to keep your assets from being wrested away and divided among the many clamoring hands of mass democracy, you will be able to establish your own private realm of governance.</p>
<p class="indent">The dramatic phase change from mass democracy to the ultimate form of self-government, individual sovereignty, need not involve a radical shift in public opinion, nor a miraculous vote, by disenchanted electors opting to scrap mass democracy. Such a revolution can begin, indeed, already has begun, invisibly, with the leasing of sovereign territory for use as tax-free zones, “Zona Francas,” and free ports. In due course, sovereignty will fragment repeatedly until it is so completely fissured that dividing it further would not yield a value sufficient to offset the transaction costs of devolution. Given Moore’s Law and Gilder’s Corollary, that bandwidth triples each year, there is no basis at present to foresee any early end to the devolutionary trend. To the contrary, we anticipate that the apparently solid power of nation-states currently devoted to mass democracy will splinter in tens of thousands of fragments into a system more reminiscent of the medieval period than the modern industrial age.</p>
<p class="indent">In due course, even nation-states that retain rump institutions of mass democracy will experience a significant shift in policies to accommodate the new metaconstitutional realities. As William Keech, a faithful advocate of democracy, argues in <i class="calibre3">Economic Politics: The Costs of Democracy:</i> “People learn to want what they see they can get, but they can also change their minds if they see that they do not like what they wanted and what they got.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch10en12" href="part0023_split_010.html#ch10-en12" class="calibre4">12</a></sup> In other words, the fact that mass democracy with conventional institutions of representative government is hailed everywhere as the twentieth century draws to an end could be a “sell signal.” It by no means assures that such decision rules will stand the test of time, even in their own terms. Remember, when you look outside politics, there is scarcely any evidence of executives, administrators, coaches, or other professional leaders being selected democratically. To the contrary, the most successful leaders are routinely hired by proprietors through selection processes in which those with the greatest interests at stake have an unequal and disproportionately greater say in determining the outcome. If democratic selection were truly a superior method to identify competent leaders, you would expect to see it as a universal decision rule. Instead, it is confined almost solely to the political realm. In short, it is more reasonable on current evidence to assume that the provision of sovereignty services is hobbled by the dominance of democratic decision-making than it is to assume the opposite, namely, that corporate and <span id="page_337" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="337"></span>business organizations suffer, because they are run by executives installed by proprietors rather than according to a show of hands.</p>
<p class="indent">By the middle of the twenty-first century it is likely that the proliferation of proprietary jurisdictions of fragmented sovereignty will have conclusively demonstrated the advantages of proprietary administration. Voters will see that they suffer for being saddled with mass democracy. Therefore, as Professor Keech suggests, they will come to see that the benefits derived from employee control of government are outweighed by its costs. They will migrate toward reform. Even electorates in Europe and North America that now seem so strongly committed against reform could eventually vote to make their regions more accommodating to proprietary governance. Majorities may willingly, even gladly abandon the farce of politics in favor of proprietary management of government which actually aims toward achieving the optimum setting for concluding and enforcing contracts.</p>
<p class="indent">To the extent that government with its familiar accoutrements survives at all, it may be informed in entirely new ways. Somewhere, in some jurisdiction, sometime before the crack of doom, someone will realize the potential that computer technology offers to make possible truly representative government. The supposed problem of excessive campaign expenditures and the undoubted annoyance of chronic political campaigning could be resolved in an instant. Rather than being elected, representatives could be selected by sortition entirely at random, with a high statistical probability that their talents and views would match those of the population at large.</p>
<p class="indent">This would be merely a modern version of the ancient Greek system of selection by lot. As E. S. Staveley details in his authoritative history, <i class="calibre3">Greek and Roman Voting and Elections,</i> numerous positions in Athens, from the magistrates to the archons, were selected by sortition as a substitute for elections. This was cleverly accomplished, in spite of mechanical limitations on the randomization of chances, through use of an allotment machine, “or, as it was called by the Athenians, the <i class="calibre3">cleroterion.”</i><sup class="sup"><a id="ch10en13" href="part0023_split_010.html#ch10-en13" class="calibre4">13</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">A series of black and white beans were used as random counters to determine who would be selected to fill various offices, as well as “to determine the order in which the tribal sections in the Council were to take their turns as <i class="calibre3">prytaneis.”</i><sup class="sup"><a id="ch10en14" href="part0023_split_010.html#ch10-en14" class="calibre4">14</a></sup> The classic provenance of this idea may give it an extra measure of credibility. But its main appeal is precisely that it would avoid the drawbacks of self-selection in politics. It would statistically assure that fewer lawyers and egomaniacs engrossed the public’s business.</p>
<p class="indent">Legislatures could be composed of true representatives. Since they would not be brought together by the pursuit of power, and would have a negligible chance of being selected again by sortition in any event, they would be free to conduct the affairs of government and formulate policy on the basis of a rational analysis of the issues.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><span id="page_338" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="338" class="calibre2"></span><i class="calibre5">Straight Commission</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">Today, politicians bent on optimizing votes have little incentive to analyze problems coherently. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that their records in actually solving problems are so pathetic as compared to entrepreneurs, business executives, and coaches of sports teams, who are rewarded according to performance. Performance-based compensation for legislators would not make everyone chosen at random as effective as Lee Kuan Yew. But paying leaders on the basis of their performance is just a logical extension of Lee’s successful “Flexiwage” program in Singapore, which pays government employees on the basis of the real growth of the Singapore economy. There is every reason to believe that performance would be greatly enhanced if the pay of legislators and executives were keyed to some objective measure of performance, such as the growth of after-tax per capita income. Pay them on the basis of performance, and the chance that they would perform would increase a thousandfold.</p>
<p class="indent">The gain to society from policies that improve real income net of taxes could be huge. Why not pay prime ministers and presidents even a tiny share of the gain that their policies promote? The funding for such payments could be collected by a small, unobtrusive tax. Such an arrangement would free society from the threat it now faces from ambitious men with specialized political talent like Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote2a">
<p class="block"><i class="calibre3">“They brought him gold, silver and clothing; but the ‘Christ’ distributed all these things to the poor. When gifts were offered he and his female companion would prostrate themselves and offer up prayers; but then rising to his feet, he would order the assembly to worship him. Later, he organized an armed band, which he led through the countryside, waylaying and robbing travellers they met on the way. But here too his ambition was not to become rich but to be worshipped. He distributed all the booty to those who had nothing—including, one may assume, his own followers.”</i><sup class="sup"><a id="ch10en15" href="part0023_split_010.html#ch10-en15" class="calibre4">15</a></sup></p>

<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">Messianic Personalities</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">Too little attention has been paid to the fact that electoral politics lures disordered, messianic personalities into positions of power. Such persons existed, and often posed serious threats to social order even in agrarian societies before the emergence of democratic political systems. Reviewing the careers of Eudo de Stell, the Breton Christ, Adelbert in the eighth <span id="page_339" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="339"></span>century, Eon in the eleventh, Tanchelm of Antwerp, Melchior Hoffman, and Bernt Rothmann and their ilk, several points stand out. The more immediately obvious their political talents seem to be, the greater the damage they appear to have inflicted. Because the state was not yet engaged in organizing widespread systematic coercion, these early protopoliticians frequently took it upon themselves to rob and loot in order to obtain cash to distribute to their followers among the poor.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">Protopoliticians in action</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">The stories of their antics give one the impression of talents out of time, like reading about seven-foot men running up and down a court before the invention of basketball. Today, thanks to the NBA, freakishly tall men are making millions dribbling and dunking. If basketball disappeared, they would recede again into the crevices of society, probably appearing mostly as circus attractions and in sideshows.</p>
<p class="indent">Demagogues before politics was invented were drawn to the nearest approximation of politics the agrarian world had to offer: itinerant preaching. They harangued crowds and, like politicians, eloquently promised a better life to those who would follow them. Then as now, the poor were the chief targets of demagogues. Norman Cohn’s great history of millenarian movements, <i class="calibre3">The Pursuit of the Millennium,</i> recounts the careers of numerous messianic leaders before polling. It is easy to recognize in his descriptions the strong similarities in personality type with the charismatic politician of the modern period.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote2">
<p class="block">[T]he leader has—like pharaoh and many another “divine king”—all the attributes of an ideal father: he is perfectly wise, he is perfectly just, he protects the weak. But on the other hand, he is also the son whose task is to transform the world, the Messiah who is to establish a new heaven and a new earth and who can say of himself: “Behold, I make all things new!” And both as father and as son this figure is colossal, superhuman, omnipotent. He is credited with such abundance of supernatural powers that it is imagined as streaming forth as light.… Moreover being thus filled with this divine spirit the eschatological leader possesses unique miracle-working powers. His armies will be invariably and triumphantly victorious, his presence will make the earth yield prodigious crops, his reign will be an age of such perfect harmony as the old, corrupt world has never known.</p>
<p class="block1i">This image was of course a purely phantasic one, in the sense that it bore no relation to the real nature and capacity of any human being who ever existed or ever could exist. It was nevertheless an image which could be projected on to a living man; and there were always men about who were more than willing to accept such a projection, who in fact passionately desired to be <span id="page_340" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="340"></span>seen as infallible, wonder-working saviours.… And the secret of the ascendancy which they exercised never lay in their birth nor to any great extent in their education, but always in their personalities. Contemporary accounts of these messiahs of the poor commonly stress their eloquence, their commanding bearing and their personal magnetism. Above all one gets the impression that even if some of these men may perhaps have been conscious impostors, most of them really saw themselves as incarnate gods.… And this total conviction would communicate itself easily enough to the multitudes whose deepest desire was precisely for an eschatological saviour.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch10en16" href="part0023_split_010.html#ch10-en16" class="calibre4">16</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="indent">While this passage is marvelously concise in describing the would-be millenarian saviors who frequently unsettled medieval society, it cannot give the full flavor of Cohn’s magisterial survey. One cannot read the whole work without recognizing in the antics of these <i class="calibre3">prophetae</i> the familiar characteristics of the modern demagogue: the eloquence, “the personal magneticism,” the “messianic pretensions,” and the recurring desire to be worshiped as tribune of the poor.</p>
<p class="indent">The main difference that one discerns between the reception of medieval society to these impostors and that afforded by democracy at the end of the twentieth century is that in the Middle Ages such persons were normally executed, whereas, at the end of the twentieth century, modern democratic politics provides them with an open channel by which to legitimately seize power in the nation-state.</p>
<p class="indent">A system that routinely submits control over the largest, most deadly enterprises on earth to the winner of popularity contests between charismatic demagogues is bound to suffer for it in the long run.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">Pay Leaders to Do a Good Job</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">As suggested above, it would be easy to stipulate a superior method for securing talented leadership for an organization: hiring it. This is the method most widely and successfully used in competitive economies. A rational selection process, combined with a constructive incentive structure to reward positive leadership, would bring able people to the helm of government. It would also mobilize new types of talent who otherwise would not normally take an interest in the problems of governance.</p>
<p class="indent">The most talented executives in the world could be attracted to run faltering governments if they could be paid on the basis of results they actually achieve for society. A leader who could significantly boost real income in any leading Western nation could justly be paid far more than Michael Eisner. In a better world, every successful head of government would be a multimillionaire.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><span id="page_341" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="341" class="calibre2"></span><i class="calibre5">Electronic Plebiscites</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">Another obvious alternative to representative misgovernment would be electronic plebiscites whereby citizens, perhaps a representative fraction selected by tamper-proof sortition, could cast their ballots directly on legislative proposals. Computer technology allows decisions to be determined, with electronic plebiscites. Plebiscites could be easily combined with allotment to narrow the numbers voting on specific issues. In any event, in principle, it is far less challenging for would-be voters to understand political issues than to attempt to fathom politicians and evaluate these politicians’ evaluations of the same issues, much less know what those politicians would actually do upon assuming office. This is particularly difficult in that politicians and their handlers are becoming increasingly proficient at packaging and manipulating the images they present to the public.</p>
