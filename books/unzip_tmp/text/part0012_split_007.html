<h2 class="h1" id="calibre_pb_7">T<span class="smallcaps1">HE</span> E<span class="smallcaps1">VOLUTION OF</span> P<span class="smallcaps1">ROTECTION</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Lane developed an argument that we have misappropriated for our purposes in imagining how the Information Age may unfold. He argued that the history of Western economies since the Dark Ages can be interpreted in terms <span id="page_182" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="182"></span>of four stages of competition and monopoly in the organization of violence. While Lane is largely silent about the megapolitical factors that we identify as influencing the scale at which governments operate, his exploration of the economics of violence coincides closely with the argument we spelled out in <i class="calibre3">Blood in the Streets</i> and <i class="calibre3">The Great Reckoning,</i> and elsewhere in this volume.</p>
<p class="indent">We have already analyzed some of the megapolitical factors that played a role in the evolution of Western society following the fall of Rome. Lane also examined this period, focusing on the economic consequences of that competition to monopolize violence. He discerned four important stages in the functioning of economies over the past thousand years, each involving a different phase in the organization of violence.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch06-fn2" href="part0012_split_009.html#ch06fn2" class="calibre4">II</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">Out of the Dark Ages</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">The first stage is one of “anarchy and plunder” that marked the feudal revolution of a thousand years ago. While Lane does not specify the dates for any of his summary periods, arithmetic sets the boundary of his first period quite clearly, and his description of the stage of “anarchy and plunder” seems to match conditions during the transition from the Dark Ages when the use of violence was “highly competitive, even on land.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch06en44" href="part0023_split_006.html#ch06-en44" class="calibre4">44</a></sup> He does not say why, but when violence is “highly competitive,” this usually means that there are significant obstacles to the projection of power at any distance. In military terms, defense is predominant over the offense.</p>
<p class="indent">For reasons we explained in Chapter 3, this stage of “anarchy and plunder” coincided with falling productivity of agriculture due to adverse climatic changes. Since technology offered few effective economies of scale to help in securing a monopoly of violence at the time, competition between would-be rulers was widespread. Economic activity was smothered.</p>
<p class="indent">The weakness of the economy made the problem of establishing a stable order worse. To create a local monopoly of violence involved too high a cost in military activity in proportion to the meager value of economic turnover. Without the capacity to enforce an effective monopoly over an economically viable territory, the armed knights on horseback terrorized and plundered while providing little in the way of “protection” for their customers.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">Feudalism</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">“The second stage begins when small regional or provincial monopolies are established. Agricultural production then rises, and most of the surplus is <span id="page_183" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="183"></span>collected by recently established monopolists of violence.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch06en45" href="part0023_split_006.html#ch06-en45" class="calibre4">45</a></sup> Still, the surplus is relatively meager during this second stage, which we identify with the early Middle Ages. Economic growth is held down by the absence of advantages of scale in the organization of violence, which keeps the military costs of enforcing local monopolies high. But while the costs remain high, the price that minisovereignties can charge for protection rises, since economic activity expands when anarchy is curtailed.</p>
<p class="indent">“During a late phase of the second stage many tribute takers attract customers by special offers to agricultural and commercial enterprise. They offer protection at low prices for those who will bring new lands into cultivation, and special policing services to encourage trade such as that organized by the Counts of Champagne for merchants coming to their fairs.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch06en46" href="part0023_split_006.html#ch06-en46" class="calibre4">46</a></sup> In other words, when they were able to establish a sufficient control over territory to negotiate credibly, local warlords did what local merchants do when they need to increase market share: they discounted their services to attract customers. The warlords later used the added resources from additional economic activity to consolidate their control over larger territories. Once that control was firmly established, they began to enjoy more of the advantages of monopoly. Their military costs for policing tended to fall, and they could also increase the price they charged without worrying that this made their service less attractive to customers.</p>
<p class="indent">In this complicated stage in Western history, those who employ violence, the medieval lords and monarchs, take most of the surplus above subsistence. There are few merchants. The most successful are those who are best able to evade or minimize the taxes, fees, and other costs imposed by those demanding money for “protection services.”</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">The Early-Modern Period</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">A third stage is reached when the merchants and landowners who are not also specialists in violence “are getting more of the economy’s surplus than are fief holders and monarchs.… In this third stage, the enterprises specializing in the use of violence receive less of the surplus than do enterprises that buy protection from the governments.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch06en47" href="part0023_split_006.html#ch06-en47" class="calibre4">47</a></sup> Since successful merchants are more likely to reinvest their profits than consume them, the higher profits of merchants in that stage in history led to self-reinforcing growth.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">The Factory Age</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">Lane identifies the passage from the third to the fourth stage with the emergence of technological and industrial innovations as more important factors in earning profits than lowering the costs of protection. By this, Lane seems to refer to the period since 1750. From that time on, the character of <span id="page_184" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="184"></span>technology began to play a clearly dominating role in the prosperity of regions. To take an extreme case, even areas where no government existed at all, as was the case in some parts of New Zealand, for example, prior to 1840, were not likely to become highly prosperous simply because they paid no taxes. At that point in history, innovations in industrial technology were more important to achieving profits than any savings that could be had by lowering the costs for protection, even to zero. As the scale of government rose, the credit and financing mechanisms originally pioneered by governments to raise resources for military operations became available to finance business enterprises of larger scale.</p>
<p class="indent">Although Lane does not say so, the concentration of technological advantages in a given locale reduced the competition between jurisdictions and allowed “enterprises specializing in the use of violence,” or governments, to charge higher prices. When there are large technological gaps between the competitors in one jurisdiction and another, as there were during the Industrial Age, entrepreneurs in the jurisdictions with the best technology tend to make more money, even though they may have to pay higher taxes and other costs to their governments.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">Plunder with a Smile</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">Governments in the Industrial Age enjoyed a delightful monopoly to exploit. Their actual costs for providing protection of life and limb were vanishingly small relative to the prices (taxes) they charged. Yet they really were in a realm where competition was so perverse that they could engage far more in the business of plunder than in that of protection and still have that fact go all but unnoticed. It was a rare moment in history.</p>
<p class="indent">The drawbacks of anarchy under the megapolitical conditions of industrialism made competition in protection services within the same territory technologically infeasible. The only way to achieve effective protection under those conditions was to command a greater capability to employ violence. Therefore there was little to be gained by attempting to better distinguish that portion of one’s taxes that went, in Lane’s words, “as payment for the service rendered” from “another part that one is tempted to call plunder.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch06en48" href="part0023_split_006.html#ch06-en48" class="calibre4">48</a></sup> The distinction was surely real enough. But since one was stuck paying the taxes in any event, developing it fully had little to commend it other than satisfying morbid curiosity. As Lane said, no matter what portion of the taxes was plunder they were a price one had to pay “to avoid more severe losses.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch06en49" href="part0023_split_006.html#ch06-en49" class="calibre4">49</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="h2"><span id="page_185" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="185" class="calibre2"></span><i class="calibre5">The Rise of Incomes Under Industrialism</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">Part of the reason this dilemma was tolerable during the past two centuries of domination by the nation-state was the fact that incomes were rising dramatically, particularly in the jurisdictions where most industrial development was confined. Those running the OECD governments took a higher percentage of incomes almost every year. But the increase in plunder was nonetheless accompanied by far greater prosperity, and a greater inequality of wealth with the rest of the world. Under such conditions, objections to the surge of taxation were inevitably marginal and insufficient to deflect events from their logical progression. Indeed, for reasons spelled out in previous chapters, the military survival of an industrial nation-state largely depended upon the fact that no effective limits could be placed upon its claims on the resources of its citizens.</p>
<p class="indent">In every industrial state, policies meandered in more or less the same direction. At the high-water mark of industrialism after World War II, the rate of marginal income taxes reached 90 percent or higher. This was a far more aggressive assertion of the right of the state to extract resources than even the Oriental despots of the early hydraulic civilizations were prone to make. Yet the industrial version of plunder followed its own logic. Much of it was determined by the character of industrial technology in the first half of the twentieth century that we described earlier.</p>
<p class="indent">This technology made it all but inevitable that the state would seize and redistribute a large fraction of income, with much of the burden of the plunder falling upon a small segment of capitalists. Most industrial processes were heavily dependent on natural resources, and therefore tied to the sites where the resources were located. A steel mill, a mine, or a port could be moved only at staggering expense, or not at all. Such facilities were therefore stationary targets that could easily be taxed. Property, corporate, and severance taxes grew sharply over this century. So did income taxes, first on the capitalists, but eventually on the workers themselves. The advent of large-scale industrial employment made a broadly based income tax practical. Wages could be garnished at the source, with the tax authorities coordinating collections with the accounting departments of industrial firms. We take this for granted today, but collecting an income tax at the factory gate was a far simpler task than fanning out over the countryside to squeeze a portion of the profits from millions of independent craftsmen and farmers.</p>
<p class="indent">In short, industrial technology tended to make taxation more routinized, more predictable, and less personally dangerous than taxation in many earlier periods. Nonetheless, it extracted a higher percentage of society’s resources than any form of sovereignty had done before.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><span id="page_186" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="186" class="calibre2"></span><i class="calibre5">Protecting What?</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">The fact that societies could become richer while the total percentage of income absorbed in taxes rose significantly invites a question about the character of the protection that governments provided to industrial economies. What were they protecting? Our answer: primarily industrial installations with high capital costs and significant vulnerability to attack. The presence of large-scale industrial firms would not have been possible in a disordered environment with more competitive violence, even if the result of the competition had been to shrink the overall share of output taken by government.</p>
<p class="indent">This is why capital-intensive operations are uneconomic in the American slums, as well as in Third World societies where ad hoc violence is endemic. Industrial society as a whole was able to proceed because a certain kind of order was established and maintained. Enterprises were subject to regular, predictable shakedowns, rather than erratic violence.</p>
<p class="indent">Even during the height of industrialism, it was always an exaggeration to speak of a government employing a “monopoly of force.” All governments try to maintain such a monopoly, but as we have seen, employees of industrial corporations usually found that they were able to employ violence against their employers. As long as the general public has access to any arms at all, or a disorderly crowd retains the physical capacity to overturn a bus or throw rocks at police, those who control the government do not totally monopolize force. They merely control predominant force, dominant to a degree that it becomes uneconomic for most people to compete with them under existing conditions.</p>

<p class="block"><i class="calibre3">“A Net-based government can operate only by consent of the governed. Any Net government must therefore provide its citizens with real benefits if it wants them to stick around. Those benefits may not be just personal goods or services, but rather the broader benefits of a regulatory regime: a clean, transparent marketplace with defined rules and consequences, or a supervised community where children can trust the people they encounter of individual's privacy is protected.”</i><sup class="sup"><a id="ch06en50" href="part0023_split_006.html#ch06-en50" class="calibre4">50</a></sup></p>

<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">The Information Age</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">The Information Age is bringing into being a fifth stage in the evolution of competition in the use of violence in the West. This stage was not anticipated <span id="page_187" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="187"></span>by Lane. This fifth phase involves competition in cyberspace, an arena not subject to monopolization by any “violence-using enterprise.” It is not subject to monopolization because it is not a territory.</p>
<p class="indent">Although Lane’s argument incorporates conventional postwar assumptions about the inevitability of the nation-state, he recognized a point that will be more crucial to understanding the future than it may have seemed forty or fifty years ago. That is the fact that governments have never established stable monopolies of coercion over the open sea. Think about it. No government’s laws have ever exclusively applied there. This is a matter of the utmost importance in understanding how the organization of violence and protection will evolve as the economy migrates into cyberspace, which has no physical existence at all. For the same reasons that Lane noted in observing that no government has ever been able to monopolize violence on the sea, it is even less likely that a government could successfully monopolize an infinite realm without physical boundaries.</p>
