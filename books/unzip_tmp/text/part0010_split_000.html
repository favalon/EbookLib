<p class="noindent">To speak of the coming death of politics is bound to seem ridiculous or optimistic, depending on your disposition. Yet that is what the Information Revolution is likely to bring. For readers reared in a century saturated in politics, the idea that life could proceed without it may seem fanciful, the equivalent to claiming that one could live merely by absorbing nutrients from the air. Yet politics in the modern sense, as the preoccupation with controlling and rationalizing the power of the state, is mostly a modern invention. We believe it will end with the modern world just as the tangle of feudal duties and obligations that engrossed the attentions of people in the Middle Ages ended with the Middle Ages. During the feudal period, as <span id="page_96" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="96"></span>historian Martin van Creveld points out, “politics did not exist (the very concept had yet to be invented, and dates back only to the sixteenth century).”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch04en2" href="part0023_split_004.html#ch04-en2" class="calibre4">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The thought that politics, as we now know it, did not exist prior to the modern period may seem surprising, especially given that Aristotle had written an essay of that title in the days of Alexander the Great. But look closely. Words used in ancient texts are not necessarily contemporary concepts. Aristotle also wrote an essay entitled <i class="calibre3">Sophistical Refutations,</i> a term about as meaningless today as <i class="calibre3">Politics</i> was in the Middle Ages. The word simply was not in use. Its first known appearance in English dates to 1529.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch04en3" href="part0023_split_004.html#ch04-en3" class="calibre4">3</a></sup> Even then, “politics” appears to have been a pejorative, derived from an Old French word, <i class="calibre3">politique,</i> used to describe “opportunists and temporizers.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch04en4" href="part0023_split_004.html#ch04-en4" class="calibre4">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">It took almost two thousand years for Aristotle’s latent concept to emerge with the meaning we now know. Why? Before the modern world could put Aristotle’s word to a meaningful use, megapolitical conditions were required that dramatically raised the returns to violence. The Gunpowder Revolution, which we analyzed in <i class="calibre3">The Great Reckoning,</i> did just that. It raised the returns to violence far above what they had ever been. This made the question of who controlled the state more important than it had ever been. Logically and inevitably, politics emerged from the struggle to control the sharply increased spoils of power.</p>
<p class="indent">Politics began five centuries ago with the early stages of industrialism. Now it is dying. A widespread revulsion against politics and politicians is sweeping the world. You see it in news and speculation on the hidden details of Whitewater, and the poorly disguised murder of Vincent Foster. You see it in numerous other scandals touching President Bill Clinton. You see in it reports of embezzlement by leading congressmen from the House Post Office. You see it in scandals leading to resignations in John Major’s circle, and similar scandals in France, reaching two recent prime ministers, Eduard Balladur and Alain Juppe. Even larger scandals have been revealed in Italy, where-seven-time prime minister Giulio Andreotti was brought to the dock to stand trail on charges that included links to the Mafia and ordering the murder of Mino Pecorelli, an investigative journalist. Still other scandals have tarnished the reputation of Spanish prime minister Filipe Gonzales. Corruption allegations cost four Japanese prime ministers their jobs in the first five years of the 1990s. Canada’s Justice Department alleged in a letter to Swiss authorities that former prime minister Brian Mulroney had received kickbacks on a C$1.8 billion sale of Airbus planes to Air Canada.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch04en5" href="part0023_split_004.html#ch04-en5" class="calibre4">5</a></sup> Willy Claes, the secretary-general of NATO, was forced to resign under a cloud of corruption allegations. Even in Sweden, Mona Sahlin, a deputy prime minister and presumptive prime minister, was forced to resign in the face of allegations that she used government credit cards to purchase diapers and <span id="page_97" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="97"></span>other household goods. Almost everywhere you turn in countries with mature welfare states once thought of as well governed, people hate their political leaders.</p>
