<p class="noindent">We offered a paradoxical explanation in Chapter 5, namely that democracy flourished as a fraternal twin of Communism precisely because it facilitated unimpeded control of resources by the state. This conclusion may seem silly to the Manchichaean “common sense” of the industrial era. We do not deny that within the terms of industrial society, democratic systems and Communism were stark opposites. But seen from a megapolitical perspective, as they may more likely be seen from the vantage of the Information Age, the two systems had more in common than, you would have been led to suspect.</p>
<p class="indent">In a setting where weaponry was grotesquely expensive, democracy became the decision mechanism that maximized control of resources by the state. Like state socialism, democratic systems made available huge sums to fund a massive military establishment. The difference was that the democratic welfare state placed even greater resources in the hands of the state than could the state socialist systems. That is saying something, because the state socialist or Communist systems laid claim to practically every asset worth having.</p>
<p class="indent">Seen dispassionately, democracy was superior to state socialism as a recipe for enriching the state. As we explained earlier, democracy made substantially more money available to the military because democracy was compatible with private ownership and capitalist productivity.</p>
<p class="indent">The state socialist system was predicated upon the doctrine that the state owned everything. The democratic welfare state, by contrast, made more limited initial claims. It pretended to allow private ownership, although of a contingent kind, and thereby harnessed superior incentives to mobilize output. Instead of mismanaging everything from the start, democratic governments in the West allowed individuals to own property and accumulate wealth. Only after the wealth had been created did the democratic nation-states step in to tax a large fraction of it away.</p>
<p class="indent">The word “Large” should be capitalized. For example, in 1996 the <span id="page_329" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="329"></span>lifetime federal tax rate at the highest brackets in the United States stood at seventy-three cents on the dollar. For owners of corporations, who received their income through dividends, the rate was eighty-three cents on the dollar. And for anyone who sought to leave or give wealth to grandchildren, the federal tax rate was ninety-three cents on the dollar. When state and local taxes are considered as well, democratic government at all levels confiscates the lion’s share of each dollar earned in the United States. Predatory tax rates made the democratic state a <i class="calibre3">de facto</i> partner with a three-quarters to nine-tenths share in earnings. This was not the same thing as state socialism, to be sure. But it was a close relation.</p>
<p class="indent">The democratic state survived longer because it was more flexible and collected more prodigious quantities of resources compared to those available in Moscow or East Berlin.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">“Inefficiency, Where It Counted”</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">We have described the megapolitical advantages of democracy as a decision rule for a powerful government as “inefficiency, where it counted.” Compared to Communism, the welfare state was indeed a far more efficient system. But compared to a genuine laissez-faire enclave like colonial Hong Kong, the welfare state was inefficient. Growth rates in Hong Kong were fabulous, but their superiority lay precisely in the fact that the resident of Hong Kong, not the government, was able to pocket 85 percent of the benefits of faster growth.</p>
<p class="indent">Hong Kong, of course, was never a democracy. Indeed, it is a mental model of the kind of jurisdiction that we expect to see flourish in the Information Age. In the Industrial Age, Hong Kong had no need to be a democracy, as it was spared the unpleasant necessity of gathering resources to support a formidable military establishment. Hong Kong was defended from the outside, so it could afford to maintain a really free economy.</p>
<p class="indent">It was precisely the capacity to rake in resources that made democracy supreme during the megapolitical conditions of the Industrial Age. Mass democracy went hand in hand with industrialism. As Alvin Toffler has said, mass democracy “is the political expression of mass production, mass distribution, mass consumption, mass education, mass media, mass entertainment, and all the rest.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch10en4" href="part0023_split_010.html#ch10-en4" class="calibre4">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Now that information technology is displacing mass production, it is logical to expect the twilight of mass democracy. The crucial megapolitical imperative that made mass democracy triumph during the Industrial Age has disappeared. It is therefore only a matter of time until mass democracy goes the way of its fraternal twin, Communism.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><span id="page_330" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="330" class="calibre2"></span><i class="calibre5">Mass Democracy Incompatible with the Information Age</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">A moment’s reflection shows that the technology of the Information Age is not inherently a mass technology. In military terms, as we have indicated, it opens the potential for “smart weapons” and “Information War,” in which “logic bombs” could sabotage centralized command and control systems. Not only does information technology clearly point toward the perfection of weapons operated by specialists; it also reduces the decisiveness of warfare, improving the relative position of the defense. Microtechnology makes possible dramatic gains in the military power of individuals, while reducing the importance of massed infantry formations. As the Rand Corporation reported to the secretary of defense: “Interconnected networks may be subject to attack and disruption not just by states but also by nonstate actors, including dispersed groups and even individuals.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch10en5" href="part0023_split_010.html#ch10-en5" class="calibre4">5</a></sup> What is more, this implies that cyberwar will realize the potential diseconomies to scale inherent in mass, centralized systems.</p>
<p class="indent">In the words of the Rand experts, “Information-based techniques render geographical distance irrelevant; targets in the continental United States are just as vulnerable as in-theatre targets.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch10en6" href="part0023_split_010.html#ch10-en6" class="calibre4">6</a></sup> Whereas there used to be safety implied in residence within the boundaries of large, superpower nation-states like the United States, in the Information Age the logic of aggregating power could be reversed. Peoria may be far from any potential military front, but it will no longer be safe from cyberattack by almost any potential antagonist. Residing within the borders of a superpower will mean putting yourself within the bull’s-eye. Instead of federating, locales may make themselves more secure by disaggregating. The advent of cyberwar will increase the vulnerability of centralized command-and-control systems, while increasing the competitive viability of dispersed systems.</p>
<p class="indent">The feedback mechanisms this will stimulate could accelerate the devolutionary process. As the Rand experts suggest, in order to lessen the vulnerability to cyberattack of the command-and-control systems that have evolved during the late stages of the nation-state, governments will be obliged to increase “the exploitation of new software encryption techniques.” This will make these mainly private-sector systems far less vulnerable to sabotage, while accelerating the commercial dispersion of hard encryption, which will help free them from state domination. This, too, will give impetus to devolution. As we argued earlier, it will further propel the dispersion of resources into cyberspace, where they will be beyond the reach of politics.</p>
<p class="indent">Ultimately, this means the end of mass democracy, especially in its predominant form, representative misgovernment, either of the congressional or parliamentary type.</p>
