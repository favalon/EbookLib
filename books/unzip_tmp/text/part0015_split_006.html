<p class="noindent">Our main focus in this book is on objective “megapolitical” factors that alter the costs and rewards of human choices. The underlying premise upon which the predictive power of the analysis rests is that individuals will seek rewards and shun costs. This is an essential truth of what Charles Darwin called “the economy of nature.” But it is not the whole truth. Simple reward optimization does not explain everything in life. However, it does illuminate two of the three main forms of human sociality, identified by Pierre Van Den <span id="page_281" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="281"></span>Berghe as “reciprocity and coercion.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch09en43" href="part0023_split_009.html#ch09-en43" class="calibre4">43</a></sup> By “reciprocity” Van Den Berghe means “cooperation for mutual benefit.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch09en44" href="part0023_split_009.html#ch09-en44" class="calibre4">44</a></sup> The most complex and far-reaching examples of reciprocity are market interactions: trading, buying, selling, producing, and other economic activities. “Coercion is the use of force for one-sided benefit, that is, for purposes of intra-specific parasitism or predation.” <sup class="sup"><a id="ch09en45" href="part0023_split_009.html#ch09-en45" class="calibre4">45</a></sup> As we have explored in this volume and two previous books, we believe that coercion is a crucial element in human society, a larger one than is usually recognized. Coercion helps determine the security of property and limits the ability of individuals to enter into mutually beneficial cooperation. Coercion underlies all politics. The third element in Van Den Berghe’s typology of human sociality is “kin selection,” the cooperative behavior that animals undertake with their kin. Kin selection, which is described more fully below, is also a crucial feature of the “economy of nature.”</p>
<p class="indent">As Jack Hirshleifer has written, “[T]he revival of Darwinian evolutionary selection theory as applied to problems of social behaviour, which has come to be known as sociobiology,” has “a distinctly economic aspect.” And:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote2">
<p class="block">Looking over the whole realm of life, sociobiology is attempting to find the general laws determining the multifarious forms of association among organisms. For example, Why do we sometimes observe sex and families, sometimes sex without families, sometimes neither sex nor families? Why do some animals flock, others remain solitary? Within groups, why do we sometimes observe hierarchical dominance patterns, sometimes not? Why do organisms in some species partition territories, others not? What determines the selflessness of the social insects, and why is this pattern so rare in Nature? When do we see resources allocated peacefully, when by means of violence? These are questions both posed and answered in recognizably economic terms. Sociobiologists ask what are the net advantages of the observed association patterns to the organisms displaying them, and what are the mechanisms whereby these patterns persist in social equilibrium states. It is perhaps this assertion of <i class="calibre3">economic-behavioural continuity</i> between man and other life-forms (termed “genetic capitalism” by one detractor) that explains the hostility of some ideologues to sociobiology…<sup class="sup"><a id="ch09en46" href="part0023_split_009.html#ch09-en46" class="calibre4">46</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="indent">We introduce sociobiology into our analysis of nationalism because it provides perspective on aspects of human nature that help facilitate systematic coercion. We agree with natural scientist Colin Tudge, author of <i class="calibre3">The Time Before History,</i> that before we can understand the current world, much less gain a perspective on that to come, we need to understand the preface to history. That means we must “look at ourselves on the grand scale of time.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch09en47" href="part0023_split_009.html#ch09-en47" class="calibre4">47</a></sup> Tudge reminds us “that beneath the surface tremors of our lives there are much deeper and more powerful forces at work that in the end affect us all and all our fellow creatures.…”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch09en48" href="part0023_split_009.html#ch09-en48" class="calibre4">48</a></sup> We suspect that among <span id="page_282" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="282"></span>“these deeper and more powerful forces” is a genetically influenced motivational component undergirding nationalism. As Hirshleifer points out, paraphrasing Adam Smith and R. H. Coase, <i class="calibre3">“human desires are ultimately adaptive responses</i> shaped by man’s biological nature and situation on earth.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch09en49" href="part0023_split_009.html#ch09-en49" class="calibre4">49</a></sup> This comes to the fore with the obviously biological allusions in most discussions of nationalism. Even in the United States, a conspicuously multiethnic nation, the government is personified in familial terms as <i class="calibre3">“Uncle</i> Sam.”</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">The Biological Inheritance</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">In short, human nature, the origin of species, and their development by natural selection are elements to be considered in understanding the continuing evolution of human society. In the present case we are considering the likely human response to new circumstances occasioned by information technology. Particularly, we are focusing on the reaction to the advent of the cybereconomy and its many consequences, including the emergence of economic inequality more pronounced than anything seen in the past. Keys to at least some of the expected response lie in our genetic inheritance.</p>
<p class="indent">When a new species is formed, it does not discard all the DNA that it carried in its previous form, but adds to it. The whole difference between a human being and a chimpanzee is contained in less than 2 percent of the DNA in each species; slightly over 98 percent of their DNA is common to both, and some of it can be traced back to very primitive early organisms, far down the historic chain of development.</p>
