<p class="noindent">Notwithstanding the firm grip the nation-state as the “in-group” has had on the modern imagination, able people who do not already doubt the utility of affiliating with a grossly expensive “imagined community” soon will. Indeed, the partisans of the nation-state have already begun to complain of the growing detachment of the cognitive elites. The late Christopher Lasch, in his diatribe <i class="calibre3">The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy,</i> assails those “whose livelihoods rest not so much on the ownership of property as on the manipulation of information.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch09en74" href="part0023_split_009.html#ch09-en74" class="calibre4">74</a></sup> Lasch laments the extranational character of the emerging information economy. He writes:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote2">
<p class="block">the markets in which the new elites operate is now international in scope. Their fortunes are tied to enterprises that operate across national boundaries. They are more concerned with the smooth functioning of the system as a whole than with any of its parts. Their loyalties—if the term is not itself anachronistic in this context—are international rather than regional, national or local. They have more in common with their counterparts in Brussels or Hong Kong than with the masses of Americans not yet plugged into the network of global communications.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch09en75" href="part0023_split_009.html#ch09-en75" class="calibre4">75</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="indent">Although Lasch was far from a dispassionate observer, and he obviously meant his portrait of the information elite to be unflattering, his contempt for those who are liberated from the tyranny of place rests on a perception of some of the same developments that are the focus of this book. When we <span id="page_295" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="295"></span>read Lasch’s critiques or those of Mickey Kaus <i class="calibre3">(The End of Equality),</i> Michael Walzer <i class="calibre3">(Spheres of Justice),</i> or Robert Reich <i class="calibre3">(The Work of Nations),</i> we see parts of our analysis confirmed, often unhappily, by authors who are deeply unsympathetic to many of the consequences of the deepening of markets, much less the denationalization of Sovereign Individuals. Lasch lambastes those with extranational ambitions “who covet membership in the new aristocracy of brains” for “cultivating ties with the international market in fast-moving money, glamour, fashion and popular culture.” He continues:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote3a">
<p class="block">It is a question whether they think of themselves as Americans at all. Patriotism, certainly, does not rank very high in their hierarchy of virtues. “Multiculturalism,” on the other hand, suits them to perfection, conjuring up the agreeable image of a global bazaar in which exotic cuisines, exotic styles of dress, exotic music, exotic tribal customs can be savored indiscriminately, with no questions asked and no commitments required. The new elites are at home only in transit, en route to a high-level conference, to the grand opening of a new franchise, to an international film festival or an undiscovered resort. Theirs is essentially a tourist’s view of the world—not a perspective likely to encourage a passionate devotion to democracy.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch09en76" href="part0023_split_009.html#ch09-en76" class="calibre4">76</a></sup></p>

<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">Economic Nationalism</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">Lurking behind criticisms of the “transients” who make up the virtual communities of the Information Age is a recognition that for many in the elite the benefits of transience already exceed their costs. Critics like Lasch and Walzer do not dispute that clearheaded cost-benefit analysis makes citizenship obsolete for persons of high skills. They do not propose that those among the information elite whose attitudes they despise have miscalculated where their best interests lie. Nor do they pretend that the compound-interest tables really show that continuing to pump one’s money into a national social security program, much less income taxes, produces a better return than private investment. To the contrary, they understand arithmetic. They have seen the sums to their obvious conclusions. But rather than acknowledge the subversive logic of economic rationality, they recoil from it, counting it as “betrayal” for the information elite to transcend the tyranny of place and abandon “the unenlightened.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch09en77" href="part0023_split_009.html#ch09-en77" class="calibre4">77</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Like Pat Buchanan, the social democrats are economic nationalists who resent the triumph of markets over politics. They denounce “the new aristocracy of brains” for being detached from place and not caring passionately about their view of where the best interests of the masses lie. While they do not explicitly recognize the denationalization of the individual as such, they <span id="page_296" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="296"></span>rail against its early hints and manifestations, what Walzer describes as “the imperialism of the market,” or the tendency of money to “seep across boundaries” in order to buy things which, as Lasch elaborates, “should not be for sale,” such as exemption from military service.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch09en78" href="part0023_split_009.html#ch09-en78" class="calibre4">78</a></sup> Note the reactionary harking to the military demands of the nation-state as a sacred ground upon which money and markets should not trespass.</p>
<p class="indent">These criticisms of the information elite anticipate the terms of a popular reaction against the rise of Sovereign Individuals in the next millennium. As new, more market-driven forms of protection become available, it will become increasingly evident to the large numbers of able persons that most of the supposed benefits of nationality are imaginary. This will lead not only to better accounting of the opportunity costs of citizenship, it will also create new ways of framing allegedly “political” and even “economic” questions. For the first time, “an individual entrepreneur acting for and by himself” will be able to vary his own protection costs by moving between jurisdictions, without waiting for them to be effected by “group decision and group action,” to quote Frederic C. Lane’s formulation of an old dilemma.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch09en79" href="part0023_split_009.html#ch09-en79" class="calibre4">79</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">As the price paid for protection becomes subject “to the principle of substitution,” this will lay bare the arithmetic of compulsion, intensifying conflict between the new cosmopolitan elite of the Information Age and “the information poor,” the remainder of the population who are largely monoglot and do not excel in problem-solving or possess some globally marketable skill. These “losers” or “left-behinds,” as Thomas L. Friedman describes them, will no doubt continue to identify their well-being with the political life of existing nation-states.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch09en80" href="part0023_split_009.html#ch09-en80" class="calibre4">80</a></sup></p>
