<p class="noindent">It is no secret that democracy has been relatively rare and, fleeting in the history of governments. In those times, ancient and modem, where democracy has prevailed, it has depended for its success upon megapolitical conditions that reinforced the military power and importance of the masses. Historian Carroll Quigley explored these characteristics in <i class="calibre3">Weapons Systems and Political Stability.</i><sup class="sup"><a id="ch10en2" href="part0023_split_010.html#ch10-en2" class="calibre4">2</a></sup> They have included:</p>
<p class="noindentt">1. <b class="calibre7">Cheap and widely dispersed weaponry.</b> Democracy tends to flourish when the cost to purchase useful weapons is low.</p>
<p class="noindentt">2. <b class="calibre7">Weapons that can be used effectively by amateurs.</b> Democracy is more likely when anyone can use effective weapons without extended training.</p>
<p class="noindentt">3. <b class="calibre7">A military advantage for a large number of participants on foot in battle.</b> As Quigley points out, “[P]eriods of infantry dominance have been periods in which political power has been more widely dispersed within the community and democracy has had a better chance to prevail.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch10en3" href="part0023_split_010.html#ch10-en3" class="calibre4">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="indentt">This is hardly a comprehensive catalogue of the conditions under which democracy can exist. If it were, democracy would not have become a <span id="page_328" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="328"></span>triumpliant system at the end of the twentieth century. Weapons were arguably more expensive in the twilight of the industrial era than ever. And many of the most effective weapons definitely required specialists to be used effectively. Furthermore, the Gulf War between the United States, its allies, and Iraq proved how vulnerable large contingents of infantry are, even when nestled in trenches and dug-in fortifications. So why has democracy appeared to flourish under these conditions as the twentieth century winds down?</p>
