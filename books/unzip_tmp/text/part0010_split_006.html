<h2 class="h1" id="calibre_pb_6">A P<span class="smallcaps1">ARALLEL FOR</span> T<span class="smallcaps1">ODAY</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Medieval society, seemingly so stable and secure in its beliefs in the middle of the fifteenth century, was rapidly transformed. Its predominant institution, the Church, saw its monopoly challenged and shattered. Authority that had been unquestioned for centuries was suddenly in dispute. Beliefs and loyalties more sacred than those that bind any citizen to a nation-state today were reconsidered and renounced within a few short years, all because of a technological revolution that came into its own in the last decade of the fifteenth century.</p>
<p class="indent">We believe that change as dramatic as that of five hundred years ago will happen again. The Information Revolution will destroy the monopoly of power of the nation-state as surely as the Gunpowder Revolution destroyed the Church’s monopoly. There is a striking analogy between the situation at the end of the fifteenth century, when life had become thoroughly saturated by organized religion, and that of today, when the world has become saturated with politics. The Church then and the nation-state today are both examples of institutions grown to a senile extreme. Like the late-medieval Church, the nation-state at the end of the twentieth century is a deeply indebted institution that can no longer pay its way. Its operations are ever more irrelevant and even counterproductive to the prosperity of those who not long ago might have been its staunchest supporters.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">“Impoverished, Grasping, and Extravagant”</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">Just as government today offers poor value for the money it collects, so did the Church at the end of the fifteenth century. As ecclesiastical historian <span id="page_113" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="113"></span>Euan Cameron put it, “[A]n impoverished local priesthood seemed to offer a poor service for the money it demanded; much of what was levied effectively ‘disappeared” into enclosed monasteries or the arcane areas of higher education or administration. In spite of gifts prodigally given to some sectors of the Church, the institution as a whole managed to appear simultaneously impoverished, grasping, and extravagant.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch04en33" href="part0023_split_004.html#ch04-en33" class="calibre4">33</a></sup> It would be hard to deny the parallel with late-twentieth-century government.</p>
<p class="indent">Religious observances in the late fifteenth century grew like programs proliferating in welfare states today. Not only did special benedictions multiply endlessly, along with the supply of saints and saints’ bones, but every year there were more churches, more convents, more monasteries, more friaries, more confessors (resident household priests), more preacherships, more cathedral chapters, more endowed chantries, more relic cults, more religious co-fraternities, more religious festivals, and new holy days. Services grew longer. Prayers and hymns grew more complicated. One after another, new mendicant orders appeared to beg for alms. The result was institutional overload similar to that characterizing heavily politicized societies today.</p>
<p class="indent">Religious festivals and feast days proliferated on all sides. Religious services grew more numerous, with special festivals in honor of the seven sorrows of Mary, of her sisters, and of all the saints of Jesus’ genealogy.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch04en34" href="part0023_split_004.html#ch04-en34" class="calibre4">34</a></sup> For the faithful to meet their religious obligations became increasingly costly and burdensome, much as the costs of remaining within the law have proliferated today.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">Innocents Pay</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">Then as now, the productive bore a growing burden of income redistribution. These costs were rising more sharply than anyone in authority recognized because of a shift in the use of capital. The relative advantage of holding land as compared to money capital was falling. Yet the medieval mind continued to think in terms of a status-bound society, where social position was determined by who you were, rather than by your skill in deploying capital effectively. Little or no consideration was given to the rising opportunity costs of staging exaggerated religious observances. These costs fell most heavily upon the more ambitious and hardworking peasants, burghers, and yeoman farmers, who depended more than the aristocracy upon deploying their capital usefully. They were obliged to shoulder a disproportionate cost of outfitting the tables at the endless feasts and holy days (holidays), as well as paying to support an extravagant Church bureaucracy.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><span id="page_114" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="114" class="calibre2"></span><i class="calibre5">Counterproductive Regulation</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">At the end of the fifteenth century, the Church largely controlled the regulatory powers that have since been assumed by governments. The Church dominated important areas of law, recording deeds, registering marriages, probating wills, licensing trades, titling land, and stipulating terms and conditions of commerce. The details of life were almost as thoroughly regulated by canon law as they are today by bureaucracy, and to much the same end. Just as political regulation today has become riddled with confusions and contradictions, so canon law was five hundred years ago. These regulations often suppressed and complicated commerce in ways that revealed that facilitating productivity was far from the minds of the regulators.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, it was forbidden to do business for an entire year on whatever day of the week the most recent twenty-eighth of December happened to fall. Thus if it was a Tuesday, no legal business could be conducted on Tuesdays as an obligatory expression of piety in honor of the Slaughter of the Innocents. On years when December 28 fell on any day other than Sunday, this injunction hampered the potential for many types of commerce, increasing costs by delaying transactions or forestalling them altogether.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">Monopoly Pricing</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">Canon law was also imposed to reinforce monopoly prices. The Church earned significant revenues from the sale of alum mined from its properties in Tolfa, Italy. When some of its customers in the textile industry showed a preference for cheaper alum imported from Turkey, the Vatican attempted to sustain its monopoly pricing through canon law, declaring it sinful to use the less costly alum. Merchants who persisted in purchasing the cheaper Turkish product were excommunicated. The famous ban on eating meat on Friday originated in the same spirit. The Church was not only the largest feudal landholder; it also held major fisheries. Church Fathers discovered a theological necessity for the pious to eat fish, which not incidentally ensured a demand for their product at a time when transport and sanitary conditions discouraged fish consumption.</p>
<p class="indent">Like the nation-state today, the late-medieval Church not only regulated specific industries to directly underpin its own interests; it also made the most of its regulatory powers to gain revenue for itself in other ways. Clerics went to special pains to promulgate regulations and edicts that were difficult to abide by. For example, incest was very broadly defined, so that even remote cousins and persons related only by marriage required special dispensation from the Church to marry. As this included almost everyone in many small European villages before the era of modern travel, selling waivers for <span id="page_115" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="115"></span>incestuous marriages became a thriving source of Church revenue. Even sex within marriage itself was tightly circumscribed by ecclesiastic regulation. Sexual relations between spouses were illegal on Sundays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, as well as for forty days prior to Easter and Christmas. Further, couples were to abstain from sex for three days prior to receiving communion. In other words, married couples were forbidden to enjoy sex without an indulgence for a minimum of 55 percent of the days of the year. In <i class="calibre3">The Bishop's Brothels,</i> historian E. J. Burford suggests that these “idiotic” regulations of marriage helped stimulate the growth of medieval prostitution, from which the Church profited mightily.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch04en35" href="part0023_split_004.html#ch04-en35" class="calibre4">35</a></sup> Burford reports that the Bishop of Winchester was for many centuries the principal of London’s Bankside brothels in Southwark. Further, ecclesiastical profiteering from prostitution was by no means merely a local English affair:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote2">
<p class="block">Pope Sixtus IV (c. 1471) who allegedly caught syphilis from one of his many mistresses—became the first pope to issue licences to prostitutes and to levy a tax on their earnings, augmenting vastly the papal revenues in the process. Indeed the Roman Curia partly financed the building of St. Peter’s by this tax and the sale of licences. His successor, Pope Leo X, is said to have made some twenty-two thousand gold ducats through the sale of licences, four times as much as he made by selling indulgences in Germany.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch04en36" href="part0023_split_004.html#ch04-en36" class="calibre4">36</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="indent">Even the famous rule of celibacy imposed on priests was a lucrative source of revenue for the medieval Church. As Burford reports, the Church imposed “a racket known as <i class="calibre3">cullagium,"</i> a fee imposed upon “concubinary priests.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch04en37" href="part0023_split_004.html#ch04-en37" class="calibre4">37</a></sup> This proved so lucrative that it was imposed uniformly upon all priests by bishops in France and Germany, in spite of the fact that the Lateran Council in 1215 had denounced “this disgraceful traffic by which such prelates regularly sell permission to sin.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch04en38" href="part0023_split_004.html#ch04-en38" class="calibre4">38</a></sup> It was merely one of many lucrative markets for the sale of licenses to infringe canon law and regulation, a trade motivated by the same logic that impels grasping politicians to seek arbitrary regulatory powers over commerce.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">Indulgences</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">The power to regulate arbitrarily is also the power to sell an exemption from the harm such regulations can do. The Church sold permits, or “indulgences,” authorizing everything from relief from petty burdens on commerce to permission to eat dairy products in Lent. These “indulgences” were not only sold at high prices to the aristocracy and the rich burghers. They were also packaged as lottery prizes much like the government-run lotteries of today to attract the pennies of the poor.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch04en39" href="part0023_split_004.html#ch04-en39" class="calibre4">39</a></sup> The trade in indulgences increased <span id="page_116" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="116"></span>as the Church’s expenditures outran its income. This led many to infer the obvious, that the institutional Church was using its powers primarily to raise revenues. As a contemporary critic put it, “[C]anon law was instituted solely for the purpose of making a great deal of money; whoever would be a Christian has to buy his way out of its provisions.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch04en40" href="part0023_split_004.html#ch04-en40" class="calibre4">40</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">Bureaucratic Overload</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">The costs of supporting institutionalized religion at the end of the fifteenth century had reached a historic extreme, much as the costs of supporting government have reached a senile extreme today. The more life was saturated with religion, the more expensive and bureaucratic the Church became. In Cameron’s words, “It was far easier to find people to fill the vastly increased number of Church posts at the end of the Middle Ages, than to find money to pay for them.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch04en41" href="part0023_split_004.html#ch04-en41" class="calibre4">41</a></sup> Just as bankrupt governments today scrounge for revenues in counterproductive ways, so did the Church five hundred years ago. Indeed, the churchmen used some of the same predatory tricks mastered by the politicians today.</p>
<p class="indent">The medieval Church five hundred years ago, like the nation-state today, consumed more of society’s resources than it ever had before, or ever would again. The Church then, like the state today, seemed incapable of functioning and sustaining itself on even record amounts of revenue. Just as the state has come to dominate late-industrial economies, spending more than half of all revenue in some Western European countries, so the Church dominated the late-feudal economy, draining resources and retarding growth.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">Deficit Spending in the Fifteenth Century</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">The Church resorted to every conceivable expedient to squeeze more money out of its charges to feed its overgrown bureaucracy. Regions directly under the lordship of the Church were required to pay higher and higher taxes. In provinces and kingdoms where the Church lacked direct taxing power, the Vatican imposed “annates,” a payment to be made by the local sovereign in lieu of direct ecclesiastic taxes.</p>
<p class="indent">The Church, like the state today, also raided its own coffers, diverting funds from benefactions earmarked for specific uses to pay for general overhead expenses. Benefices and venal religious offices were openly sold, as were the income streams from tithes. In effect, the interests in tithes became the ecclesiastic equivalent of bonds issued by modern governments to finance their chronic deficits.</p>
<p class="indent">While the Church was the ideological defender of feudalism and critic of commerce and capitalism, like the nation-state today, it utilized every <span id="page_117" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="117"></span>available marketing technique to optimize its own revenues. The Church operated a thriving business in the sale of sacramentals, including consecrated candles, palms blessed on Palm Sunday, “herbs blessed on the Feast of the Assumption, and especially the varieties of Holy Water.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch04en42" href="part0023_split_004.html#ch04-en42" class="calibre4">42</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Like today’s politicians who threaten constituents with curtailed garbage pickup and other indignities if they decline to pay higher taxes, religious authorities in the fifteenth century were also prone to cutting off religious services to blackmail congregations into paying arbitrary fines. Often the fines were imposed for some petty offense done by a few persons who need not even have been members of the congregation in question. For example, in 1436, Bishop Jacques Du Chatelier, “a very ostentatious, grasping man,” closed the Church of the Innocents in Paris for twenty-two days, halting all religious services while waiting for an impossibly large fine to be paid by two beggars. The men had quarreled in the church and shed a few drops of blood, which the bishop claimed had deconsecrated the church. He would not allow anyone to use the church for weddings, burials, or the normal sacraments of the calendar until his fine was paid.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch04en43" href="part0023_split_004.html#ch04-en43" class="calibre4">43</a></sup></p>

<h3 class="h2"><i class="calibre5">Hatred of Church Leaders</i></h3>
<p class="noindent">Little wonder that the common opinion of the late fifteenth century despised the higher and lower clergy, much as common opinion in highly politicized societies today despises the bureaucracy and politicians. As Johan Huizinga put it, “Hatred is the right word to use in this context, for hatred it was, latent, but general and persistent. The people never wearied of hearing the vices of the clergy arraigned.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch04en45" href="part0023_split_004.html#ch04-en45" class="calibre4">45</a></sup> Part of the reason that people were commonly convinced that the Church was “grasping and extravagant” is that it was true. “The worldliness of the higher ranks of the clergy and the deterioration of the lower grades”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch04en46" href="part0023_split_004.html#ch04-en46" class="calibre4">46</a></sup> were too obvious to miss. From the parish priest to the pope himself, the clergy appeared to be corrupt as only the personnel of a predominant institution can be.</p>
<p class="indent">Five hundred years ago, the pope, Alexander VI, made even Giulio Andreotti and Bill Clinton seem like exemplars of integrity. Alexander VI was <span id="page_118" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="118"></span>known for his wild parties. As a cardinal in Siena, he staged a famous orgy to which only “Siena’s most beautiful young women had been invited, but their ‘husbands, fathers, and brothers’ had been excluded.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch04en47" href="part0023_split_004.html#ch04-en47" class="calibre4">47</a></sup> The Siena orgy was famous, but it later proved to be tame compared to those Alexander threw after becoming pope. Perhaps the most lurid of those was the so-called Ballet of the Chestnuts, which involved Rome’s “fifty most beautiful whores” in a copulation contest with the Church Fathers and other important Romans. As William Manchester describes it, “Servants kept score of each man’s orgasms, for the pope greatly admired virility.… After everyone was exhausted, His Holiness distributed prizes—cloaks, boots, caps, and fine silken tunics. The winners, the diarist wrote, were those who made love with those courtesans the greatest number of times.”<sup class="sup"><a id="ch04en48" href="part0023_split_004.html#ch04-en48" class="calibre4">48</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Alexander fathered at least seven and perhaps eight illegitimate children. One of his apparent sons, Giovanni, was the so-called Infans Romanus, born to Alexander’s illegitimate daughter, Lucrezia Borgia, when she was eighteen. In a secret papal bull, Alexander admitted fathering Giovanni. If he was not the father, he was certainly the grandfather on both sides. The pope was involved in a three-way incestuous affair with Lucrezia, who was also the mistress of Juan, duke of Gandia, Alexander’s oldest illegitimate son, as well as the mistress of another illegitimate son, Cardinal Cesare Borgia. Cesare was the prince of the Church who served as Niccolò Machia-velli’s inspiration for <i class="calibre3">The Prince.</i> Cesare was a killer, as was the pope, who was known to have plotted several murders. One or the other of them apparently became jealous of Juan, whose lifeless body was fished out of the Tiber River on June 15, 1497.<sup class="sup"><a id="ch04en49" href="part0023_split_004.html#ch04-en49" class="calibre4">49</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The leadership of the late-medieval Church was as corrupt as the leadership of the nation-state today.</p>
